1
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:03,232
Previously, on Elementary...

2
00:00:03,256 --> 00:00:05,196
<i>Me and Paige...</i>

3
00:00:05,296 --> 00:00:06,796
we started seeing
each other

4
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:08,464
about a year ago.

5
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:09,899
I have MS.

6
00:00:09,901 --> 00:00:11,400
I was diagnosed
two months ago.

7
00:00:11,402 --> 00:00:12,668
I've been worried
about what I'll do

8
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:13,769
to the rest of your life.

9
00:00:13,771 --> 00:00:15,271
My first thought is,
I don't care,

10
00:00:15,273 --> 00:00:17,039
I love her, I want
to be with her.

11
00:00:17,041 --> 00:00:18,441
She's gonna need a lot of help.

12
00:00:18,443 --> 00:00:22,445
Well... she's worth it.

13
00:00:24,949 --> 00:00:26,482
Let's see.

14
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:28,251
“You...

15
00:00:28,253 --> 00:00:31,521
can light up a room”?

16
00:00:32,557 --> 00:00:34,290
That's not a fortune!
Eh, I know.

17
00:00:34,292 --> 00:00:36,893
They're all like that now.
They're compliment cookies.

18
00:00:36,895 --> 00:00:38,861
Course, I'm gonna think
about this much differently

19
00:00:38,863 --> 00:00:41,297
if you get lit on fire
someday. So be careful.

20
00:00:41,299 --> 00:00:43,966
Maybe we ought to switch
it up next week.

21
00:00:43,968 --> 00:00:46,035
No false advertising

22
00:00:46,037 --> 00:00:48,004
when it comes to pizza.

23
00:00:48,973 --> 00:00:50,806
“Good test results

24
00:00:50,808 --> 00:00:53,509
will soon be yours”.

25
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:55,011
Wow.

26
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:57,079
Let me see that.

27
00:00:57,081 --> 00:00:59,882
It says
“You're a joy to know.”

28
00:00:59,884 --> 00:01:01,784
Ah...

29
00:01:01,786 --> 00:01:04,253
I hope you're not this gullible
when it comes to interrogations.

30
00:01:04,255 --> 00:01:07,056
There aren't many suspects
I like as much as I do you.

31
00:01:08,793 --> 00:01:11,060
You'll call me tomorrow
when the lab results come in?

32
00:01:11,062 --> 00:01:13,196
Absolutely.

33
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:14,163
All right.

34
00:01:14,165 --> 00:01:15,965
But I can tell you...

35
00:01:15,967 --> 00:01:17,833
I feel really good.

36
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,437
You feel good to me, too.

37
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:25,007
Don't work too late.

38
00:01:29,514 --> 00:01:30,947
Um...

39
00:01:30,949 --> 00:01:33,049
Excuse me. Hi.

40
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:35,518
We haven't been formally
introduced. I'm Paige Cowan.

41
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,821
I've seen you around here,
and wanted to come say hi.

42
00:01:38,823 --> 00:01:40,923
Yeah, you're the captain's,
uh, girlfriend.

43
00:01:40,925 --> 00:01:43,793
Yeah, uh, Sherlock Holmes.
Delighted.

44
00:01:43,795 --> 00:01:46,629
Sorry to interrupt
whatever you're doing.

45
00:01:46,631 --> 00:01:48,731
Oh, no. No need to apologize.
I'm just, um...

46
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:50,466
I was just aping the expression

47
00:01:50,468 --> 00:01:52,935
of notorious horse thief,
Wyatt Feldon.

48
00:01:52,937 --> 00:01:54,937
It's an experiment
to see how long

49
00:01:54,939 --> 00:01:56,906
I have to maintain his
countenance before it affects

50
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:59,375
my mood and, uh, mindset.

51
00:01:59,377 --> 00:02:01,310
Oh.

52
00:02:01,312 --> 00:02:02,945
Uh, you were a
police officer once.

53
00:02:02,947 --> 00:02:04,180
Do you retain any
of your training,

54
00:02:04,182 --> 00:02:05,481
or did you block it all out

55
00:02:05,483 --> 00:02:07,383
because it ended in scandal?

56
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,821
Mm. Maybe this wasn't
such a great idea.

57
00:02:11,823 --> 00:02:13,589
Maybe what wasn't
such a good idea?

58
00:02:15,793 --> 00:02:18,027
Well, I hear you wear
a couple of hats.

59
00:02:18,029 --> 00:02:20,963
You consult here,
and you take private clients.

60
00:02:20,965 --> 00:02:22,698
I would like to hire you,

61
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,301
and I'd like you
to keep it between us.

00:03:52,057 --> 00:03:54,524
Okay. Two bodies?

77
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:56,092
Medical bills
and insurance claims.

78
00:03:56,094 --> 00:03:58,361
Pilfered from the office
of Dr. Jonas Kiel,

79
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:00,263
neurologist with
a private practice uptown.

80
00:04:00,265 --> 00:04:02,165
Oh, yeah. I would've
totally figured that out.

81
00:04:02,167 --> 00:04:04,401
The doctor treats Paige,
the captain's girlfriend,

82
00:04:04,403 --> 00:04:06,736
for her relapsing
remitting multiple sclerosis.

83
00:04:06,738 --> 00:04:09,139
She's come to suspect
that some of his support staff

84
00:04:09,141 --> 00:04:11,942
are engaged
in criminal malfeasance.

85
00:04:11,944 --> 00:04:13,543
That sounds troubling.
And kind of vague.

86
00:04:13,567 --> 00:04:14,612
Yeah, well,

87
00:04:14,613 --> 00:04:16,313
some of the ladies
that work on the front desk

88
00:04:16,315 --> 00:04:18,181
have upgraded their clothing
and their jewelry lately,

89
00:04:18,183 --> 00:04:19,816
and they've been in the habit
of accidentally

90
00:04:19,818 --> 00:04:22,098
running off extra copies
of Paige's prescriptions.

91
00:04:22,099 --> 00:04:23,439
So, she asked you
to look into it?

92
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:25,700
Yeah, well,
she wanted peace of mind.

93
00:04:25,701 --> 00:04:27,434
I-I'd ask you
not to alert the captain.

94
00:04:27,436 --> 00:04:29,069
I know it's delicate, but...

95
00:04:29,071 --> 00:04:31,672
No, no. I get it. I mean,
he'd charge right at it.

96
00:04:31,674 --> 00:04:33,340
I left a considerably
lighter footprint.

97
00:04:33,342 --> 00:04:36,043
This turned out
not to be necessary.

98
00:04:36,045 --> 00:04:37,411
The doctor's alarm system
is archaic,

99
00:04:37,413 --> 00:04:39,079
and there were no
cameras to record me

100
00:04:39,081 --> 00:04:41,615
making copies
of all his patients'

101
00:04:41,617 --> 00:04:43,417
billing and
insurance information.

102
00:04:43,419 --> 00:04:45,419
So we get to

103
00:04:45,421 --> 00:04:47,854
audit his practice.

104
00:04:47,856 --> 00:04:50,590
Not exactly what I had
in mind for today.

105
00:04:50,592 --> 00:04:52,559
I'm gonna get some coffee.

106
00:04:52,561 --> 00:04:54,227
No. Get dressed.

107
00:04:54,229 --> 00:04:56,763
Or... get undressed.
Your choice.

108
00:04:56,765 --> 00:04:57,898
Excuse me?

109
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,299
Marcus has requested
our presence

110
00:04:59,301 --> 00:05:01,501
at a clothing optional retreat.

111
00:05:02,538 --> 00:05:04,538
It's for a case, right?

112
00:05:12,648 --> 00:05:14,414
Thanks, Ms. Murphy.

113
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:16,683
I think you'll be a little more
comfortable this way.

114
00:05:16,685 --> 00:05:18,819
I think <i>you'll</i> be
more comfortable.

115
00:05:18,821 --> 00:05:21,254
But if's fine. Go ahead.

116
00:05:21,256 --> 00:05:24,257
The victim, he wasn't
carrying ID. Obviously,

117
00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:26,460
We're assuming he was
a guest here at the retreat,

118
00:05:26,462 --> 00:05:29,663
but we don't really...
His name is Kenneth Tolan.

119
00:05:29,665 --> 00:05:30,931
Did you know him well?

120
00:05:30,933 --> 00:05:33,233
Eh, Kenny's been coming here
to Maple Grove

121
00:05:33,235 --> 00:05:36,436
since before I took over
running the place, so...

122
00:05:36,438 --> 00:05:38,505
probably '09 I guess.
Can you think of

123
00:05:38,507 --> 00:05:39,840
anyone who would've
done this to him?

124
00:05:39,842 --> 00:05:41,408
Was he on anyone's bad side?

125
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:43,176
Never.

126
00:05:43,178 --> 00:05:45,345
Kenny was a sweetheart.

127
00:05:45,347 --> 00:05:47,714
This was just terrible,

128
00:05:47,716 --> 00:05:49,316
terrible luck.

129
00:05:49,318 --> 00:05:51,818
The guy who took that woman,

130
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,687
from the news.
That's who did this.

131
00:05:53,689 --> 00:05:55,922
You're talking about
the housewife in Long Island

132
00:05:55,924 --> 00:05:58,058
taken last week? Uh, Beth Stone?

133
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,893
Yeah. That's the one.

134
00:05:59,895 --> 00:06:02,229
All over the TV. Here.

135
00:06:03,599 --> 00:06:07,000
Kenny sent that
last night.

136
00:06:07,002 --> 00:06:08,702
Probably right before
they shot him.

137
00:06:08,704 --> 00:06:12,339
“Am I crazy,
or is this the kidnapped lady?”

138
00:06:12,341 --> 00:06:14,307
He's not crazy.
It's definitely Beth Stone.

139
00:06:14,309 --> 00:06:16,243
Did you mention this
when you called 911?

140
00:06:16,245 --> 00:06:19,179
I didn't notice
the message until after.

141
00:06:19,181 --> 00:06:21,014
That music you can
hear. I think it

142
00:06:21,016 --> 00:06:23,784
was coming from the cabin.
Kenny probably got curious,

143
00:06:23,786 --> 00:06:25,352
or maybe he saw a light was on.

144
00:06:25,354 --> 00:06:28,221
The place has been under
renovation for two years.

145
00:06:28,223 --> 00:06:30,056
Nobody should've
been in there.

146
00:06:30,058 --> 00:06:31,358
Well, nobody's there now.

147
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,627
The killer took
Mrs. Stone and cleared out.

148
00:06:33,629 --> 00:06:36,196
Ma'am.
I'll be right back.

149
00:06:36,198 --> 00:06:39,432
The smell of ammonia is still
quite noxious, even from here.

150
00:06:39,434 --> 00:06:42,135
Yeah. CSU says every surface
in there was scrubbed.

151
00:06:42,137 --> 00:06:43,703
Rain last night's gonna
make it hard

152
00:06:43,705 --> 00:06:45,071
to find anything
useful out here, too.

153
00:06:45,073 --> 00:06:46,973
If it can be done,
I will see it done.

154
00:06:46,975 --> 00:06:48,408
Why don't you two
go to Long Island,

155
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:50,076
check in with the, uh,
local investigation

156
00:06:50,078 --> 00:06:52,379
into Mrs. Stone's disappearance.

157
00:06:52,381 --> 00:06:54,214
Mr. Stone, just for the record,

158
00:06:54,216 --> 00:06:56,416
that is your wife, isn't it?

159
00:06:56,418 --> 00:06:59,452
Yeah. That's Beth. Definitely.

00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:02,823
You mind if I, uh...

162
00:07:02,825 --> 00:07:04,457
Of course.

163
00:07:04,459 --> 00:07:06,760
Here you go.

164
00:07:06,762 --> 00:07:08,762
Initial file from six days
ago is on top for you.

165
00:07:08,764 --> 00:07:11,398
Mr. Stone, he, uh... he called
in the disappearance.

166
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,999
Mrs. Stone,
she ran some down here,

167
00:07:13,001 --> 00:07:14,768
brought some paperwork for him

168
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:16,436
because he was sick.
And she... she didn't come home.

169
00:07:16,438 --> 00:07:17,704
You guys have been busy.

170
00:07:17,706 --> 00:07:19,673
Yeah, well, the
file weighs plenty,

171
00:07:19,675 --> 00:07:21,308
I just wish there was more in it

172
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:23,176
for you guys.
We got interviews

173
00:07:23,178 --> 00:07:25,412
of friends, family,
most of the workers here,

174
00:07:25,414 --> 00:07:27,547
all of her social media's here,
and everything we asked

175
00:07:27,549 --> 00:07:30,016
for about the, uh...
about the business.

176
00:07:30,018 --> 00:07:31,685
Nothing unusual in all that?

177
00:07:31,687 --> 00:07:34,554
No.

178
00:07:34,556 --> 00:07:37,591
Hey, the good news
is, is that she's alive, right?

179
00:07:37,593 --> 00:07:39,826
When we didn't hear any
news about a ransom,

180
00:07:39,828 --> 00:07:42,028
we started to think
maybe a serial killer.

181
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:44,564
You know, someone who'd
just take her and...

182
00:07:44,566 --> 00:07:46,519
throw her away.

183
00:07:46,543 --> 00:07:47,602
You know, I...

184
00:07:47,603 --> 00:07:49,703
I don't understand why
this is happening to us.

185
00:07:49,705 --> 00:07:51,905
We... we live
a normal life.

186
00:07:51,907 --> 00:07:55,342
Small, quiet, we do our work
and we go home, that's it.

187
00:07:55,344 --> 00:07:57,110
You own this place, right?

188
00:07:57,112 --> 00:07:59,312
Used to.
Uh, banks own most of it, now.

189
00:07:59,314 --> 00:08:02,716
Beth and I bought it
when we got married.

190
00:08:02,718 --> 00:08:04,184
Spent most of
my inheritance on it,

191
00:08:04,186 --> 00:08:06,453
fixing the place up, and now,
ten years later,

192
00:08:06,455 --> 00:08:09,155
everything's out of date again.
You guys do

193
00:08:09,157 --> 00:08:11,625
post-production for movies?

194
00:08:11,627 --> 00:08:14,527
Local commercials, um,
we do color-correction,

195
00:08:14,529 --> 00:08:15,896
we rent out editing suites.

196
00:08:15,898 --> 00:08:17,330
I mean, it's made us broke,

197
00:08:17,332 --> 00:08:19,766
but it hasn't made us any,
like, any enemies.

198
00:08:19,768 --> 00:08:21,868
Everybody we spoke to,
they like these folks.

199
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,841
That's why we think it was a
stranger who scooped her up.

200
00:08:23,865 --> 00:08:24,805
It has to be.

201
00:08:24,806 --> 00:08:28,608
I-I don't know anybody as tall
as the guy that took her.

202
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:30,510
The security cameras got
everything out back.

203
00:08:30,512 --> 00:08:31,845
Did you guys see the footage?

204
00:08:31,847 --> 00:08:33,213
Just the clip from the news.

205
00:08:33,215 --> 00:08:35,048
We'd love to take a closer look.

206
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:38,618
I didn't even think to check
these until the next day.

207
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:41,121
We have the gun pegged as
a snub-nosed .22 revolver.

208
00:08:41,123 --> 00:08:42,889
Well, that would match
the slugs we just pulled out

209
00:08:42,891 --> 00:08:44,524
of Kenneth Tolan's skull.

210
00:08:44,526 --> 00:08:46,059
This the only angle?

211
00:08:46,061 --> 00:08:48,461
Yeah. We never do get
to see the guy's face.

212
00:08:48,463 --> 00:08:50,131
Oh. Can you freeze it,
please?

213
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:51,265
Yeah.

214
00:08:51,266 --> 00:08:54,001
What? You catch a reflection
or something?

215
00:08:54,002 --> 00:08:55,602
No. I don't think
we're going to be able

216
00:08:55,604 --> 00:08:57,304
to identify the kidnapper
from this angle,

217
00:08:57,306 --> 00:08:58,638
but the van...

218
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,975
The roof... What is that?

219
00:09:01,977 --> 00:09:03,410
That thing that looks kind
of lumpy there?

220
00:09:03,412 --> 00:09:05,011
That... you know, I've...

221
00:09:05,013 --> 00:09:06,379
I've watched this
a thousand times

222
00:09:06,381 --> 00:09:08,615
and I always thought it was
a shadow

223
00:09:08,617 --> 00:09:10,250
or a smudge on the lens.

224
00:09:10,252 --> 00:09:12,953
It's not. It's fresh paint over
an area that's been welded.

225
00:09:12,955 --> 00:09:14,955
They had to seal the roof
after they removed

226
00:09:14,957 --> 00:09:16,890
the retractable satellite mast.

227
00:09:16,892 --> 00:09:19,059
This used to be
a TV news van.

228
00:09:19,061 --> 00:09:21,761
Might be able to track it
through secondary sales market.

229
00:09:21,763 --> 00:09:23,263
Where's the nearest DMV?

230
00:09:25,734 --> 00:09:27,801
There you are.

231
00:09:27,803 --> 00:09:29,469
Did you get my texts?

232
00:09:29,471 --> 00:09:32,138
Marcus is, uh, following up a
vehicular lead in New Jersey.

233
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:35,909
I would have responded with an
update of my own if I had one.

234
00:09:35,911 --> 00:09:37,711
So no luck at Maple Grove?

235
00:09:37,713 --> 00:09:39,612
We wasted a considerable
amount of time tracking

236
00:09:39,614 --> 00:09:41,715
a boot print in the mud
to a camper who had an alibi.

237
00:09:41,717 --> 00:09:43,616
I have photographs
if you'd like to see

238
00:09:43,618 --> 00:09:44,918
what an 85-year-old man

239
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,219
wearing only hiking boots
looks like.

240
00:09:46,221 --> 00:09:49,189
Uh, I'm good.
Maybe later.

241
00:09:49,191 --> 00:09:52,025
Why don't you, uh, update
me on that Paige thing?

242
00:09:52,027 --> 00:09:53,526
Well, relatively speaking,
it's a little short

243
00:09:53,528 --> 00:09:55,228
on dead nudists
and missing women.

244
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,496
The scheme here
was quite mundane.

245
00:09:56,498 --> 00:09:57,864
Cataloging it

246
00:09:57,866 --> 00:10:00,333
is thin gruel for a mind
as lithe as my own.

247
00:10:00,335 --> 00:10:02,002
So, Paige was right,

248
00:10:02,004 --> 00:10:03,536
her doctor's running a scam?

249
00:10:03,538 --> 00:10:05,605
No, not her doctor.
Three of his clerical staff

250
00:10:05,607 --> 00:10:07,340
are double billing
insurance companies

251
00:10:07,342 --> 00:10:09,743
for prescriptions that they
claim are filled on site.

252
00:10:09,745 --> 00:10:12,579
Fortunately, Dr. Kiel seems
to have been kept in the dark,

253
00:10:12,581 --> 00:10:13,713
so I don't think he's
going to be indicted

254
00:10:13,715 --> 00:10:17,050
when, uh, when it hits the fan.

255
00:10:20,789 --> 00:10:22,255
Something's bothering you.

256
00:10:22,257 --> 00:10:23,857
No. I'm just bored.

257
00:10:23,859 --> 00:10:25,625
No, that's a different look.

258
00:10:25,627 --> 00:10:27,193
I am troubled.

259
00:10:27,195 --> 00:10:29,729
In order to do this audit,
I've had to look

260
00:10:29,731 --> 00:10:32,065
at Paige's file.

261
00:10:34,102 --> 00:10:35,535
All right. What am
I looking for?

262
00:10:35,537 --> 00:10:37,037
Method of payment.

263
00:10:38,507 --> 00:10:40,040
Her insurance lapsed.

264
00:10:40,042 --> 00:10:42,308
She was kicked off her plan
earlier this year.

265
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:45,178
Last month, she bounced
two checks to Dr. Kiel.

266
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,614
Of late, she's been charging
her treatments to a credit card.

267
00:10:47,616 --> 00:10:50,417
Teriflunomide.

268
00:10:50,419 --> 00:10:53,453
She has to have it,
but it is expensive.

269
00:10:53,455 --> 00:10:55,655
Hmm. Non-negotiable
in every sense.

270
00:10:55,657 --> 00:10:58,358
So now you see the two parts
to my malaise.

271
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,060
Drudgery and sympathy.

272
00:11:00,062 --> 00:11:01,961
I assume you took the case
pro Bono considering she is

273
00:11:01,963 --> 00:11:04,164
the captain's girlfriend.
I insisted.

274
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:06,366
Well, at least you can feel
good about helping her out.

275
00:11:06,368 --> 00:11:08,334
Well, there you go then.

276
00:11:08,336 --> 00:11:11,905
Wouldn't want to monopolize
all the good feelings.

277
00:11:13,575 --> 00:11:15,842
Captain,
any potential witnesses

278
00:11:15,844 --> 00:11:17,777
on Van Dyke or Richards Street?

279
00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:20,013
Not that I can see,
it's a ghost town over here.

280
00:11:20,015 --> 00:11:21,981
Nothing but warehouses
and vacants.

281
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,283
Congratulations, Marcus,

282
00:11:23,285 --> 00:11:25,351
looks like you
had the world's first

283
00:11:25,353 --> 00:11:27,120
satisfactory trip to the
Department of Motor Vehicles.

284
00:11:27,122 --> 00:11:30,723
Was not expecting them to help
you find the van so quickly.

285
00:11:30,725 --> 00:11:32,692
Actually, the sales
records were a bust.

286
00:11:32,694 --> 00:11:34,194
Paperwork might be
filed, but it hasn't been

287
00:11:34,196 --> 00:11:35,428
put in the system yet.

288
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:37,230
So how did you come
to invite us here?

289
00:11:37,232 --> 00:11:39,165
I found an online classified

290
00:11:39,167 --> 00:11:43,970
hawking an old news van for sale
in Camden, New Jersey.

291
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,372
Did you call the seller?

292
00:11:46,374 --> 00:11:47,607
That was a dead end, too.

293
00:11:47,609 --> 00:11:49,843
Our guy did the
deal over e-mail.

294
00:11:49,845 --> 00:11:52,212
Transfer of Title
was under a fake name.

295
00:11:52,214 --> 00:11:55,014
Oh, so how'd
you track the van down?

296
00:11:55,016 --> 00:11:57,250
Via the EZ Pass,
I imagine, yeah?

297
00:11:57,252 --> 00:12:00,120
I had the MTA ping it
as soon as I saw the ad.

298
00:12:00,122 --> 00:12:01,387
It was listed along with

299
00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:03,456
new tires and low mileage.

300
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,658
This close to the highway,
transponders like that one

301
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,560
work as well as LoJack.

302
00:12:07,562 --> 00:12:09,028
I spread the canvas
out a little wider,

303
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,296
but I don't think
we're gonna find anyone

304
00:12:10,298 --> 00:12:11,564
that saw anything.

305
00:12:11,566 --> 00:12:13,900
Department hasn't sent
a car out this way

306
00:12:13,902 --> 00:12:16,469
for any vehicle fires.

307
00:12:16,471 --> 00:12:19,005
So no one saw him torch the van.

308
00:12:19,007 --> 00:12:20,473
It was raining the
night of the murder.

309
00:12:20,475 --> 00:12:22,142
Probably not a lot of
foot traffic out here

310
00:12:22,144 --> 00:12:24,644
if he ditched it after
he shot Kenneth Tolan.

311
00:12:24,646 --> 00:12:26,045
I think they might've
divested themselves of the van

312
00:12:26,047 --> 00:12:28,214
shortly after
abducting Mrs. Stone.

313
00:12:28,216 --> 00:12:31,084
The wealth of needles back
here suggests that an addict

314
00:12:31,086 --> 00:12:32,785
camped out here
for about five days.

315
00:12:32,787 --> 00:12:34,654
Then he's way ahead of us.

316
00:12:34,656 --> 00:12:37,056
Maybe not.

317
00:12:37,058 --> 00:12:41,060
You don't think there's
fingerprints on this thing?

318
00:12:41,062 --> 00:12:42,962
Maybe digital ones.

319
00:12:44,766 --> 00:12:46,866
This SIM is from
a disposable phone.

320
00:12:46,868 --> 00:12:48,635
Was only used three times.

321
00:12:48,637 --> 00:12:50,803
All three calls
were made the day

322
00:12:50,805 --> 00:12:52,005
after your wife
was taken.

323
00:12:52,007 --> 00:12:54,274
All three were
to your cell phone.

324
00:12:54,276 --> 00:12:55,775
You didn't tell
anyone that

325
00:12:55,777 --> 00:12:57,076
the kidnappers made contact.

326
00:12:57,078 --> 00:12:59,345
Normally, that would
look bad for you,

327
00:12:59,347 --> 00:13:01,781
but you've been an open book
with the Nassau County PD,

328
00:13:01,783 --> 00:13:04,617
so we have to ask...

329
00:13:04,619 --> 00:13:06,419
were you told
not to say anything?

330
00:13:06,421 --> 00:13:08,421
It's a simple question,
Mr. Stone.

331
00:13:08,423 --> 00:13:09,856
Is this a ransom situation?

332
00:13:10,692 --> 00:13:11,724
We can't be having

333
00:13:11,726 --> 00:13:13,726
this conversation.
Cops...

334
00:13:13,728 --> 00:13:15,795
reporters,
everybody watching

335
00:13:15,797 --> 00:13:17,564
your interviews on the news,

336
00:13:17,566 --> 00:13:20,066
you let them all think this
was done by some crazy person.

337
00:13:20,068 --> 00:13:22,235
There's been a lot of time
and energy put into profiling

338
00:13:22,237 --> 00:13:24,404
this guy that could've been
better spent finding your wife.

339
00:13:24,406 --> 00:13:26,206
What choice did I have?

340
00:13:27,576 --> 00:13:28,474
He said if I

341
00:13:28,476 --> 00:13:29,642
came forward, that...

342
00:13:29,644 --> 00:13:30,977
that I would never
see her again.

343
00:13:30,979 --> 00:13:32,145
Well, you didn't go
to the police.

344
00:13:32,147 --> 00:13:33,146
We came to you.

345
00:13:33,148 --> 00:13:34,781
Doesn't matter.

346
00:13:34,783 --> 00:13:37,150
There's nothing that I could say
that will help you.

347
00:13:37,152 --> 00:13:38,351
Nothing.

348
00:13:38,353 --> 00:13:39,986
Why don't you take
a break from deciding

349
00:13:39,988 --> 00:13:41,154
what the police
need to know

350
00:13:41,156 --> 00:13:42,288
and just tell us
everything?

351
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:43,856
We can keep this
out of the media.

352
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,594
He... his voice
was disguised.

353
00:13:47,596 --> 00:13:49,429
That's-that's it.
That's...

354
00:13:49,431 --> 00:13:51,831
look, there's still time to get
him what he wants.

355
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,132
I-I can, I can handle this.

356
00:13:53,134 --> 00:13:54,634
You have time to get him what?

357
00:13:54,636 --> 00:13:56,603
How did he disguise
his voice?

358
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:00,240
Wh-What timetable
did he give you?

359
00:14:01,276 --> 00:14:02,809
Were you allowed to speak
to your wife?

360
00:14:02,811 --> 00:14:05,311
We're not gonna do this
right now.

361
00:14:05,313 --> 00:14:07,046
Uh...

362
00:14:07,048 --> 00:14:09,415
I'd like you to leave my house,
please.

363
00:14:13,722 --> 00:14:16,589
Mr. Stone, I've worked dozens
of kidnap cases.

364
00:14:16,591 --> 00:14:18,591
I'm not asking you
to rely on my, uh,

365
00:14:18,593 --> 00:14:20,493
experience and judgment alone.

366
00:14:20,495 --> 00:14:23,596
By now, you must have researched
how often these, uh,

367
00:14:23,598 --> 00:14:25,265
come to a happy conclusion.

368
00:14:25,267 --> 00:14:26,599
I just do
what I'm told.

369
00:14:26,601 --> 00:14:27,934
Every additional hour

370
00:14:27,936 --> 00:14:29,769
that Beth is held,
the chances increase

371
00:14:29,771 --> 00:14:32,672
that she will observe something
which will help her to identify

372
00:14:32,674 --> 00:14:36,376
her abductor, so the chances
decrease that he will allow her

373
00:14:36,378 --> 00:14:37,877
to live to tell the tale.

374
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:39,445
It's already been a week.

375
00:14:39,447 --> 00:14:41,681
If you ever see your wife
alive again,

376
00:14:41,683 --> 00:14:45,184
it will almost certainly be
because we found her.

377
00:14:45,186 --> 00:14:47,387
Then good luck to us all.

378
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,020
How's that looking?

379
00:15:04,044 --> 00:15:05,537
The cyan values

380
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:07,571
are turned up too high.
Everyone looks like a Smurf.

381
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,072
Dennis Karig,

382
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:11,008
you're Aaron Stone's
second-in-command, are you not?

383
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,176
Yeah. Who are you?

384
00:15:12,178 --> 00:15:13,277
I'm Sherlock Holmes.

385
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,711
I'd like a word.

386
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:16,613
So, the guy who took Beth,
he did it for money?

387
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:19,049
Well, yes, money
is one possibility...

388
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:21,318
but he may have another type
of ransom in mind.

389
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,620
I mean, I can't tell you because
your employer won't tell us.

390
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:24,721
What do you mean?

391
00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:26,623
Well, he's not cooperating
with us.

392
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:29,259
So, my colleagues and I are...

393
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,295
asking around in the hope
that he confided

394
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:33,697
some salient detail
to someone close to him.

395
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:35,659
I'm his best friend
and he hasn't told me a thing.

396
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,869
That's unfortunate.

397
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:40,471
I mean, he thinks
he's playing it safe

398
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:42,272
by following instructions.

399
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:43,740
Beth could be killed,

400
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:45,609
whether he pays
the ransom or not.

401
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,478
It's possible that...

402
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,847
that might not bother him
as much as it would you.

403
00:15:49,849 --> 00:15:51,648
What the hell is
that supposed to mean?

404
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,116
We learned from his financials

405
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,219
that he recently consulted
a divorce attorney.

406
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:56,854
The invoice
references analysis

407
00:15:56,856 --> 00:15:58,555
of a prenuptial
agreement, so...

408
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:01,124
I mean, I'm trying to decide
whether I'm being impeded

409
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,993
by a fearful imbecile
or by someone

410
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:04,895
who wishes to save on alimony.

411
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:07,164
You think he wants
the kidnapper to kill her?

412
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:09,867
No.

413
00:16:09,869 --> 00:16:11,268
No way.

414
00:16:13,506 --> 00:16:16,273
Have Aaron and Beth
had a rough go at it lately?

415
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:18,542
Yes, they fight
about this place,

416
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:20,277
the money it loses.

417
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,678
And just a few weeks ago,
they sent out invites

418
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,380
to an anniversary party
next month.

419
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:24,548
Here.

420
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:39,530
Ten years is tin, not diamonds.

421
00:16:39,532 --> 00:16:43,267
This is Beth's handwriting,
not Aaron's.

422
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:45,402
Perhaps she's still in love
and he isn't.

423
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:46,870
Look...

424
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:49,172
if this is really
a kidnap for ransom,

425
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,441
I am sure Aaron
is scrambling like crazy

426
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:52,843
to get the money
together.

427
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,611
He probably would have
sold this place by now

428
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:56,046
if it wasn't mortgaged
to the hilt.

429
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:58,882
He'd do anything for Beth.

430
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:01,418
If you say so.

431
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:07,791
Just so you know, I'm...
I'm gonna tell Aaron

432
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:09,826
that you and your friends
are here snooping around.

433
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:11,562
Yes, you do what
you feel you must.

434
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:14,131
But... she's your
friend, too, no?

435
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:15,566
So, please, ask yourself:

436
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:18,235
is Aaron really acting
in her best interest?

437
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,806
Thanks very much.

438
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:24,074
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Hey.

439
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:25,275
This is Bruce Daniels.

440
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:26,476
He produces

441
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:28,312
local commercials.

442
00:17:28,314 --> 00:17:29,780
You are close to Aaron Stone?

443
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:31,348
No, no, no, I'm just here a lot.

444
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,884
I rent out an editing bay
whenever I need one.

445
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,352
I just told her
a couple weeks ago,

446
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:36,720
I was cutting 30 seconds

447
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:37,921
for Comfort Time Mattress.

448
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:39,556
They got a new location
over on Brand.

449
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,124
I overheard Aaron in bay three

450
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:42,926
really screaming on the phone,

451
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:43,894
which is weird for him.

452
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,295
Right, but you didn't know

453
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:47,664
what he was referring to.
No, but it sounded like

454
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,666
he couldn't agree with
somebody about what to do

455
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:52,769
with this 30-year-old film
footage they had processed.

456
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:54,771
There was something pretty heavy

457
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:57,007
on this eight millimeter
film strip, I guess.

458
00:17:57,009 --> 00:18:00,043
Right, and then you overheard
Aaron saying that he was ready

459
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:02,879
to show it to the guy who was in
it and that the guy would pay.

460
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:04,247
You think it was
blackmail material?

461
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,183
It was two days
before the kidnapping.

462
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:08,619
That's all you know?

463
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:10,087
Yeah, I mind my own business.

464
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:13,390
Hey, listen,
is that accent legit?

465
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:14,658
'Cause I could get

466
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,226
you some work in radio.

467
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:18,495
I got a jewelry store
looking for a touch of class.

468
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:19,896
It pays.

469
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:21,698
Uh, pass.

470
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,767
All right, well...

471
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,169
in case you
change your mind.

472
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:27,838
Beth always
seemed real nice.

473
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,573
I hope you guys find her.

474
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:35,312
Well, uh, it would be nice to...

475
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:37,147
get a look
at that eight-millimeter film

476
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:38,582
he was yelling about.

477
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:42,786
I doubt we'll get a warrant
on hearsay evidence.

478
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,888
Yeah, I doubt
it, too.

479
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:49,092
Uh, Marcus is going
to be interviewing

480
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:51,662
the equipment manager
for a few more minutes.

481
00:18:51,664 --> 00:18:53,497
Yeah, why don't you join him?

482
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:56,767
It would be good
if that interview wasn't rushed.

483
00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:10,914
I don't think this is
gonna work-- we're gonna have

484
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:13,450
to go through everything on
this drive one file at a time.

485
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:15,252
And spend seven times
as long watching

486
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:18,288
B-roll of sandwich shop
commercials? I think not.

487
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,923
Say we're right.

488
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:23,193
Aaron found a piece of film
that is blackmail-worthy.

489
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:25,162
Only the person he
was trying to extort

490
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,364
turned the tables on him
and kidnapped Beth.

491
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:28,999
If the footage is here,
I'm gonna miss it.

492
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,134
After I have
an epileptic fit.

493
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:33,070
You find this uncomfortable
because your retinas

494
00:19:33,072 --> 00:19:35,472
are bouncing between
three different screens at once.

495
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:37,174
So? You're
covering four.

496
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,643
No. I'm staring
at a fixed point

497
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:41,645
past the screens, letting
my peripheral vision

498
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:43,447
alert me to
anything suspicious.

499
00:19:43,449 --> 00:19:46,249
You could've mentioned this
technique 15 minutes ago.

500
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:49,352
Screen six. There it was.
There what was?

501
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:52,389
You used to be such
a patient person.

502
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:54,091
So, pay no attention

503
00:19:54,093 --> 00:19:56,359
to the young man attempting
the free throw. Look at the two

504
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:59,029
figures in the
deep background.

505
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,932
Oh, there's no way
he lived through that.

506
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:03,400
This video features
the same teenager

507
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:05,368
as several that preceded it.

508
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,371
Obviously, his family
brought in their old film

509
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,540
to Stone Post
for digitization.

510
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,576
So I doubt they knew
what they had.

511
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:14,144
Aaron obviously did.

512
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:16,213
Seems like he's blown it
up to get a better look.

513
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:19,750
He's looped it, zoomed in.
Very presentational.

514
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:22,185
Maybe he did it
to show the killer.

515
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:24,621
If he figured out
who it was,

516
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:27,424
this would definitely
be blackmail-worthy.

517
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:31,161
All the signs indicate that
Aaron did determine who it was.

518
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:33,764
But how? All we have is
a face in the crowd

519
00:20:33,766 --> 00:20:35,599
of a 30-year-old snippet
of film.

520
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:39,536
So I'm at a loss
as to where to begin.

521
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:41,738
The victim's name
is Quentin Latham,

522
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:45,008
and I think the guy stabbing
him is one of the Dinacios.

523
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:47,577
The crime family.

524
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:48,945
This is the victim.
No question.

525
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:51,214
Quentin Latham was
a big union leader.

526
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:53,483
A reformer.
He clashed with the Mob.

527
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:55,952
And then he took an eight-inch
buck knife to the solar plexus.

528
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:58,355
Well, they didn't
know that back then.

529
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:00,991
He just fell off the map
in 1987.

530
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:03,026
Two years later,
his bones showed up in a box

531
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:04,928
outside the Local 127.

532
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:09,032
All the big families denied it,
but the message was clear.

533
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:10,801
What?

534
00:21:10,803 --> 00:21:12,135
You're always keen
to hear stories

535
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:13,603
about my unusual childhood,

536
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,338
but I didn't think
I had anything on you.

537
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,740
Who follows Mafia exploits

538
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:18,308
with such zeal in grade school?

539
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,310
Well, I also collected stickers.

540
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:22,679
All right, so...

541
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:24,114
Here we go.

542
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,949
This is the same guy
in that home video, right?

543
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,184
Peter Dinacio?

544
00:21:27,186 --> 00:21:29,186
He's Micki the Don's nephew.

545
00:21:29,188 --> 00:21:30,921
This Web site fairly reeks

546
00:21:30,923 --> 00:21:33,657
of a boiler room pumping
and dumping penny stocks.

547
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:35,425
The SEC has been
after him for years.

548
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:37,494
I remember reading something
about it in the paper last year.

549
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:40,163
He's been really hard to catch,
but he's going down today.

550
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:42,566
I cannot believe
we solved Quentin Latham.

551
00:21:42,568 --> 00:21:44,017
The captain is gonna freak.

552
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:45,269
Going to have
to hear about

553
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:47,070
this “freaking” secondhand.

554
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:49,272
I promised Paige I would meet
her and review my findings.

555
00:21:49,274 --> 00:21:50,707
Are you sure?
Quite.

556
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:52,108
Your childhood fetish

557
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,444
is bearing fruit, Watson--
go and enjoy it.

558
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,984
So, as you can see,
Emily Berkus was the mastermind.

559
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,352
Started double filing

560
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:03,653
those depakote prescriptions
last October.

561
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:05,255
Ariana Rodriguez
joined in the fun

562
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:06,656
a couple of months later,

563
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:08,391
and promptly expanded
the insurance fraud

564
00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:10,727
to include the, uh,
MAOI inhibitors.

565
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:13,864
Well, that explains her
diamond tennis bracelet.

566
00:22:13,866 --> 00:22:15,265
Your instincts
are quite keen.

567
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:17,067
I can see why
the captain likes you.

568
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:18,301
So now what?

569
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:20,737
Now, I send this file--

570
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:23,840
anonymously, of course--
to a friend of a friend

571
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:26,543
at the DOJ's
Health Care Fraud Unit.

572
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:28,511
Justice should be swift.

573
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:31,548
I do believe your doctor
will be spared, as I said.

574
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:34,117
There is no hint of evidence
that he was aware.

575
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:36,186
Good. I'm glad.

576
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,954
Because it's easier
for him to find

577
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:39,723
some honest people
to work the front desk

578
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:41,892
than it is for me to find
a new neurologist.

579
00:22:41,894 --> 00:22:44,794
Well, I think
that concludes our business.

580
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:46,863
I-I would like to ask you...

581
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:49,666
what are your intentions
towards the captain?

582
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:51,501
Oh, I'm gonna tell him
all of this.

583
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:53,737
I just didn't want to put him
in a spot in case I was wrong.

584
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:56,306
I meant more broadly in terms
of your future together.

585
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:58,008
What are your intentions?

586
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:01,444
Are you asking me if I'm gonna
make an honest man of him?

587
00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:03,313
Is he aware you're going broke?

588
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,583
I'm not going broke.

589
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:08,451
Your billing files
suggest otherwise.

590
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:09,719
I was just wondering,

591
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,955
is the captain going
to come to your aid?

592
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:15,825
I think we're done here.
All I wish to know...

593
00:23:15,827 --> 00:23:17,227
If you're asking me
whether I'm gonna

594
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,728
bilk Tommy for money, I'm not.

595
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,531
I know you said you wanted
to do this job pro Bono,

596
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:23,667
but you can expect
a check in the mail.

597
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:26,236
You earned it. You did the work.

598
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:28,438
Tommy was right
about you.

599
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,641
You're very good... at the work.

600
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:36,146
You have the right
to remain silent.

601
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:37,714
I know my damn rights.

602
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:39,516
I want to know why you're here.

603
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:42,852
Well, a lot of answers to
that question, Mr. Dinacio.

604
00:23:42,854 --> 00:23:44,688
You've been
awfully busy.

605
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:46,323
We know that
almost 30 years ago,

606
00:23:46,325 --> 00:23:47,857
you stabbed Quentin Latham.

607
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:49,326
We also want to talk to you
about the kidnapping

608
00:23:49,328 --> 00:23:50,727
of Beth Stone,

609
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:52,429
the shooting of Kenneth
Tolan at Maple Grove

610
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,264
Campground, and why you think...
Hold on, hon.

611
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:57,033
Back up. Look, I don't know
anything about Beth Stone

612
00:23:57,035 --> 00:23:59,302
or any campground,
but I think I do know

613
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:01,805
how you got confused
about Latham.

614
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:03,740
Well, you'll have all
the time in the world

615
00:24:03,742 --> 00:24:05,475
to explain it
to us. Come on.

616
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:07,410
You don't get it. Before
you take me downtown,

617
00:24:07,412 --> 00:24:09,179
there's something I got
to show you. Please.

618
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:12,115
Incredible, isn't it?

619
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:14,851
It's just the best.

620
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:16,953
Guys, come on.

621
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,688
That's not me.

622
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:20,123
Mr. Dinacio,

623
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,459
are you trying to set up
an insanity plea?

624
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:25,929
About a month ago, these two
guys-- Aaron and Dennis--

625
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:28,999
they came in here, they were
looking for an angel investor.

626
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:32,402
Aaron Stone and Dennis Karig
of Stone Post Production?

627
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:34,804
Yeah. Shame about
Aaron's wife,

628
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,539
but I've been keeping
a good thought.

629
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:38,375
They wanted start-up money?

630
00:24:38,377 --> 00:24:40,076
Not exactly our bag.

631
00:24:40,078 --> 00:24:42,178
But they were maxed
out with the banks,

632
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,714
they're looking for 800
grand at any rate I name.

633
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:46,249
I said I'd take the meeting.

634
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:47,951
What was the money for?

635
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:49,819
For this, for what
you're looking at.

636
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:51,388
CGI, baby.

637
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:54,024
These two-- they had
this app or whatever.

638
00:24:54,026 --> 00:24:56,893
They said it makes it so you
could do <i>Titanic</i> on your laptop.

639
00:24:56,895 --> 00:24:58,495
I wasn't buying it.

640
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,864
So, you expect us to believe
that this footage

641
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:02,699
of you killing
Quentin Latham is fake,

642
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:04,667
that this is some sort
of audition reel

643
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:07,303
to convince you to invest
in their CGI company?

644
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:08,972
They said I could
pick anything.

645
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:11,674
I knew my uncles would
get a kick out of this.

646
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:13,743
Look, you don't have
to believe me.

647
00:25:13,745 --> 00:25:16,413
I got plenty to back me up
in that drawer there.

648
00:25:16,415 --> 00:25:18,982
Go ahead.

649
00:25:23,422 --> 00:25:26,022
They changed our faces later.

650
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:27,857
The whole thing
took, like, an hour.

651
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,926
Those guys are geniuses,
I'm telling you.

652
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:32,529
Thank my lucky stars
they came to me.

653
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:36,566
We're all gonna be worth
about a gazillion dollars.

654
00:25:38,937 --> 00:25:42,172
Uncuff him.

655
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:46,943
This might explain why
someone would ransom the wife

656
00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:49,079
of a man who
is flat broke.

657
00:25:49,081 --> 00:25:52,182
Kidnapper could have
been after this software?

658
00:25:52,184 --> 00:25:54,084
Or a cut of
the profits.

659
00:25:54,086 --> 00:25:57,654
Did you tell a lot of people in
your family about this program?

660
00:25:57,656 --> 00:25:59,756
I told you,
that's who it was for.

661
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:01,724
How many people actually
saw it?

662
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,827
They showed
some people.

663
00:26:03,829 --> 00:26:05,829
Those people showed
some other people.

664
00:26:05,831 --> 00:26:07,764
I guess you could
say it went viral.

665
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:10,433
But, you know,
only in our thing.

666
00:26:10,435 --> 00:26:12,502
That's great.

667
00:26:12,504 --> 00:26:14,337
Only in his thing.

668
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:16,506
That means our list
of suspects just grew

669
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:18,708
by only a few hundred mobsters.

670
00:26:34,395 --> 00:26:36,962
Oh.

671
00:26:42,036 --> 00:26:43,969
Was that “Gimme Some Lovin'”?

672
00:26:43,971 --> 00:26:46,271
Good ear.

673
00:26:46,273 --> 00:26:48,974
Ugh! This might be the
most disturbing way

674
00:26:48,976 --> 00:26:50,876
you've ever woken me up.

675
00:26:50,878 --> 00:26:52,377
You know Steve Winwood wrote
that song

676
00:26:52,379 --> 00:26:53,812
at the tender age of 18?

677
00:26:53,814 --> 00:26:55,314
That's neat... I guess.

678
00:26:55,316 --> 00:26:57,616
I didn't know you were a fan.
Oh, I do

679
00:26:57,618 --> 00:26:59,618
appreciate his oeuvre,
but that's not the reason

680
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:01,320
for my pop music reveille.

681
00:27:01,322 --> 00:27:03,188
I've had a breakthrough
in the case.

682
00:27:05,092 --> 00:27:07,292
Can you not do that?
I have a system!

683
00:27:07,294 --> 00:27:10,128
Slumbering under a pile
of aged Mafiosos?

684
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:11,463
These are suspects.

685
00:27:11,465 --> 00:27:12,831
They are all innocent

686
00:27:12,833 --> 00:27:14,600
of kidnap and murder.

687
00:27:14,602 --> 00:27:17,502
At least in the respective cases
of Beth Stone and Kenneth Tolan.

688
00:27:17,504 --> 00:27:21,573
Today, we turn our sights
on Dennis Karig.

689
00:27:21,575 --> 00:27:22,875
Aaron's partner?

690
00:27:22,877 --> 00:27:24,443
His friend and employee.

691
00:27:24,445 --> 00:27:26,712
I told you last night,
the current theory is

692
00:27:26,714 --> 00:27:30,515
that Beth was abducted over
CGI software written by Karig.

693
00:27:30,517 --> 00:27:32,851
He did not need
to abduct his friend's wife

694
00:27:32,853 --> 00:27:34,319
to get his hands on it.

695
00:27:34,321 --> 00:27:35,687
It's sitting on his computer.

696
00:27:35,689 --> 00:27:37,489
His computer at <i>work.</i>

697
00:27:37,491 --> 00:27:39,091
That's an important distinction.

698
00:27:39,093 --> 00:27:41,159
Have a look
at the employee contract

699
00:27:41,161 --> 00:27:42,895
from Stone Post Productions.

700
00:27:42,897 --> 00:27:45,030
Just give me the highlights.

701
00:27:45,032 --> 00:27:47,633
I pulled that from the
hard drive we got at Stone Post.

702
00:27:47,635 --> 00:27:49,735
It's fairly standard
in that it lays legal claim

703
00:27:49,737 --> 00:27:51,403
to the work product
and intellectual property

704
00:27:51,405 --> 00:27:53,205
generated
by the undersigned employee.

705
00:27:53,207 --> 00:27:56,308
So Karig's software developed on
the job does not belong to him.

706
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:57,676
It belongs to Aaron Stone.

707
00:27:57,678 --> 00:27:59,478
What if Mr. Karig
was having trouble

708
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,947
motivating his friend to share
in the expected proceeds?

709
00:28:01,949 --> 00:28:05,784
That's a possible motive,
but you seem pretty certain.

710
00:28:05,786 --> 00:28:07,619
Because of Mr. Karig's taste
in music.

711
00:28:07,621 --> 00:28:11,056
He's an avid curator
of play lists,

712
00:28:11,058 --> 00:28:13,258
which he shares
via streaming services.

713
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:15,527
He relies heavily
on the work of Steve Winwood.

714
00:28:15,529 --> 00:28:17,362
Hence the little concert.

715
00:28:17,364 --> 00:28:19,498
Think about it. You might recall

716
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,200
where you've heard another one
of his songs very recently.

717
00:28:22,202 --> 00:28:24,536
♪ Bring me a higher love ♪

718
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:27,539
♪ Bring me ♪

719
00:28:27,541 --> 00:28:30,275
♪ A higher love, oh-oh... ♪

720
00:28:30,277 --> 00:28:31,877
So who's Karig working with?

721
00:28:31,879 --> 00:28:35,013
Where'd he find the big goon
that stuck Beth in the van?

722
00:28:35,015 --> 00:28:37,849
Actually, I don't think the
goon was that big after all.

723
00:28:37,851 --> 00:28:41,887
Maybe we have different ideas
of big, but this guy...

724
00:28:44,058 --> 00:28:47,225
...is Karig. Of course.

725
00:28:47,227 --> 00:28:50,028
He wrote cutting-edge software
that manipulates pixels.

726
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:52,264
We've been looking at his
handiwork this whole time.

727
00:28:52,266 --> 00:28:54,232
So he stretches himself
a foot taller,

728
00:28:54,234 --> 00:28:56,068
adds 40 pounds,
no problem.

729
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:57,636
Oh, maybe one problem.

730
00:28:57,638 --> 00:29:01,306
He altered his size,
but not his shape. Look.

731
00:29:01,308 --> 00:29:03,642
The kidnapper has
sloped shoulders.

732
00:29:03,644 --> 00:29:06,611
<i>They're hunched</i>
<i>just like Dennis Karig's.</i>

733
00:29:06,613 --> 00:29:08,480
It's not proof,
but it's a start.

734
00:29:08,482 --> 00:29:10,816
We should have CCS
have a look at this.

735
00:29:10,818 --> 00:29:13,185
They might be able to tell
the file's been tweaked.

736
00:29:13,187 --> 00:29:15,387
We could try, but
that would take time,

737
00:29:15,389 --> 00:29:17,389
and we have a missing
woman out there.

738
00:29:17,391 --> 00:29:20,258
We told the captain that we
should hit Karig with this

739
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,394
as soon as possible.

740
00:29:25,432 --> 00:29:28,100
Yeah. Well, thanks for
the heads up. We'll be ready.

741
00:29:28,102 --> 00:29:29,568
That was Gleason.

742
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:31,670
He and Crawford just
scooped up Dennis Karig.

743
00:29:31,672 --> 00:29:33,005
They're on their way.

744
00:29:33,007 --> 00:29:34,940
Excellent.
Uh, do you have a moment?

745
00:29:34,942 --> 00:29:36,341
Something wrong?

746
00:29:36,343 --> 00:29:37,776
I want to talk to you

747
00:29:37,778 --> 00:29:39,277
about your personal life,

748
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,947
specifically, uh,
your relationship with Paige.

749
00:29:41,949 --> 00:29:45,617
Well, I don't really want
to do that right now.

750
00:29:45,619 --> 00:29:47,619
Are you aware
she's in dire financial straits?

751
00:29:47,621 --> 00:29:49,221
What are you talking about?

752
00:29:49,223 --> 00:29:51,356
Well, the trouble stems
from her, uh... her condition,

753
00:29:51,358 --> 00:29:53,025
or rather, the expensive
treatments it requires.

754
00:29:53,027 --> 00:29:54,493
You weren't aware?

755
00:29:54,495 --> 00:29:57,062
Of course <i>I</i> was aware.
How are you aware?

756
00:29:57,064 --> 00:30:00,298
I've had occasion to get to
know her a bit better recently.

757
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,701
I think
you should propose marriage.

758
00:30:03,971 --> 00:30:06,238
Excuse me?
The sooner

759
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,973
you pop the question, the sooner
her treatments will be covered

760
00:30:07,975 --> 00:30:09,574
by the city's health plan.

761
00:30:10,978 --> 00:30:13,979
I think the time might have come
for a new Mrs. Gregson.

762
00:30:13,981 --> 00:30:15,580
I-I think I just got whiplash.

763
00:30:15,582 --> 00:30:18,417
When I split
with the last Mrs. Gregson,

764
00:30:18,419 --> 00:30:20,652
you told me
to consider myself lucky.

765
00:30:20,654 --> 00:30:22,954
You compared marriage
to, uh, poison,

766
00:30:22,956 --> 00:30:25,490
I think it was?
Yeah.

767
00:30:25,492 --> 00:30:27,826
Well, despite the abject failure
of your first nuptials,

768
00:30:27,828 --> 00:30:29,394
you don't have
any such misgivings

769
00:30:29,396 --> 00:30:31,096
about the institution, do you?

770
00:30:31,098 --> 00:30:33,698
So it would not be a violation
of your personal ethics.

771
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:36,268
Oh, should I phrase it like that
when I get down on my knee?

772
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:37,602
I'm not making
this recommendation

773
00:30:37,604 --> 00:30:40,105
on romantic grounds.
Open enrollment

774
00:30:40,107 --> 00:30:42,607
ends this week, and I realize
I should be the last

775
00:30:42,609 --> 00:30:44,109
of your acquaintances
to suggest marriage,

776
00:30:44,111 --> 00:30:45,844
not the first, but there it is.

777
00:30:45,846 --> 00:30:47,746
Oh, you think you're the first?
You're not.

778
00:30:47,748 --> 00:30:50,949
We're adults.
We got a great thing going.

779
00:30:52,019 --> 00:30:53,652
Everyone wants me to marry her.

780
00:30:53,654 --> 00:30:56,254
Yeah, but, you know,
their rationale is misguided,

781
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:58,123
and mine's, you know...

782
00:30:58,125 --> 00:31:01,993
Gaming the insurance industry's
what marriage is for, right?

783
00:31:01,995 --> 00:31:05,797
When things first got serious,
we talked about marriage, okay?

784
00:31:05,799 --> 00:31:08,400
She's in your camp.
She's opposed?

785
00:31:08,402 --> 00:31:11,736
Very. She had a bad trip
the first time around.

786
00:31:11,738 --> 00:31:13,538
And you're <i>not</i> opposed?

787
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,941
No.

788
00:31:15,943 --> 00:31:18,643
It's what I want.

789
00:31:21,982 --> 00:31:24,349
Listen, whatever's going on
with Paige's finances,

790
00:31:24,351 --> 00:31:27,352
we're just gonna have
to figure it out another way.

791
00:31:27,354 --> 00:31:29,788
All right? Gregson.

792
00:31:34,795 --> 00:31:37,028
Just because this guy had
hunched shoulders like me?

793
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:38,463
I mean, he could be anybody

794
00:31:38,465 --> 00:31:40,632
who works a desk job.
Sitting ruins your posture.

795
00:31:40,634 --> 00:31:42,000
Maybe we'll get
around to talking

796
00:31:42,002 --> 00:31:43,502
to all office
workers everywhere,

797
00:31:43,504 --> 00:31:45,337
but we're starting with you.

798
00:31:45,339 --> 00:31:47,739
You failed to mention you
are proficient in creating

799
00:31:47,741 --> 00:31:50,709
computer-generated imagery
last time we spoke, Mr. Karig.

800
00:31:50,711 --> 00:31:53,712
I didn't think you'd come
to hear about my hobbies.

801
00:31:53,714 --> 00:31:57,616
Uh, look, if someone messed
with the security tape,

802
00:31:57,618 --> 00:32:00,085
they could've made
the kidnapper look like anyone.

803
00:32:00,087 --> 00:32:02,087
Yeah. You're a technical genius,
Mr. Karig.

804
00:32:02,089 --> 00:32:04,589
No one here is accusing you
of creative brilliance.

805
00:32:04,591 --> 00:32:06,591
This is crazy.
I told you,

806
00:32:06,593 --> 00:32:08,126
I was home
when this happened.

807
00:32:08,128 --> 00:32:10,862
When she was taken or
when Kenneth Tolan got shot?

808
00:32:10,864 --> 00:32:13,098
Both.

809
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,033
Both times.

810
00:32:15,035 --> 00:32:18,069
I was alone because I live
alone. That's not a crime.

811
00:32:18,071 --> 00:32:19,571
It's not much of an alibi
either.

812
00:32:19,573 --> 00:32:21,439
But let's forget about that
for the moment

813
00:32:21,441 --> 00:32:23,742
and focus on your taste
in firearms.

814
00:32:23,744 --> 00:32:26,711
You purchased a .22-caliber
revolver last month.

815
00:32:26,713 --> 00:32:28,280
Just like the one there.

816
00:32:28,282 --> 00:32:30,749
Must've been around the time
you hatched your plan.

817
00:32:30,751 --> 00:32:33,552
The day you realized that
Aaron was gonna make a bundle

818
00:32:33,554 --> 00:32:35,620
off your work and
pay you peanuts.

819
00:32:35,622 --> 00:32:37,322
No. Th-That's not true.

820
00:32:37,324 --> 00:32:38,924
We're still negotiating
my compensation.

821
00:32:38,926 --> 00:32:40,959
Is that what you call
kidnapping his wife?

822
00:32:40,961 --> 00:32:42,427
Can we just stop
and think about this?

823
00:32:42,429 --> 00:32:44,196
How stupid
would I have to be to try

824
00:32:44,198 --> 00:32:47,032
to abduct someone who knows me
without wearing a mask?

825
00:32:47,034 --> 00:32:48,800
She'd be able to identify me.

826
00:32:48,802 --> 00:32:51,303
Not if you kill her once
you get what you want.

827
00:32:51,305 --> 00:32:52,804
It's what you do, right?

828
00:32:52,806 --> 00:32:54,439
Get rid of all
the evidence,

829
00:32:54,441 --> 00:32:56,541
disguise your voice,
you burn the van,

830
00:32:56,543 --> 00:32:58,643
kill the witness,
bleach the cabin.

831
00:32:58,645 --> 00:33:00,845
You're a real thorough guy.
Tell you what though...

832
00:33:00,847 --> 00:33:02,647
Karig hasn't cracked, has he?

833
00:33:02,649 --> 00:33:04,416
Not yet.
Good.

834
00:33:04,418 --> 00:33:06,885
We don't need a false confession
to explain at trial.

835
00:33:06,887 --> 00:33:08,119
Detective Bell,

836
00:33:08,121 --> 00:33:10,522
Mr. Holmes,
would you step out, please?

837
00:33:10,524 --> 00:33:12,424
What's going on?

838
00:33:12,426 --> 00:33:14,292
Beth Stone just
wandered into a diner

839
00:33:14,294 --> 00:33:17,128
down in Great Kills Park, couple
miles from that nudist resort

840
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:18,563
where they had her.
“They”?

841
00:33:18,565 --> 00:33:19,731
The kidnappers.

842
00:33:19,733 --> 00:33:21,266
She says there were two of them.

843
00:33:21,268 --> 00:33:23,702
Karig doesn't fit
either description.

844
00:33:23,704 --> 00:33:26,271
Not even close.

845
00:33:26,273 --> 00:33:28,473
Like I said,
there were two of them.

846
00:33:28,475 --> 00:33:32,143
Um, Rashad. I-I think
that was the little one.

847
00:33:32,145 --> 00:33:35,513
And-and Ali is the one
who took me.

848
00:33:35,515 --> 00:33:37,749
They didn't... they didn't use
their names in front of me,

849
00:33:37,751 --> 00:33:39,684
but I heard them whispering
in their language.

850
00:33:39,686 --> 00:33:42,320
I had a roommate once
who was Pakistani.

851
00:33:42,322 --> 00:33:44,289
I think that's what
they were.

852
00:33:44,291 --> 00:33:46,891
Hey. You're doing great,
honey.

853
00:33:46,893 --> 00:33:48,893
So, we've got Rashad

854
00:33:48,895 --> 00:33:50,195
and Ali?

855
00:33:50,197 --> 00:33:52,364
Ali's the one who shot
that man at the cabin.

856
00:33:52,366 --> 00:33:55,834
And then he took me to this tent
back in those woods.

857
00:33:55,836 --> 00:33:58,203
Rashad was-was
very angry,

858
00:33:58,205 --> 00:34:00,038
and he took over
watching me all the time.

859
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,773
Except sometimes
he'd leave the tent

860
00:34:01,775 --> 00:34:03,708
to-to go out
and smoke a cigarette.

861
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:05,910
That's when I'd work
on my ropes.

862
00:34:05,912 --> 00:34:08,246
They-they had
my wrists tied

863
00:34:08,248 --> 00:34:10,749
to a-a stake
in the ground, like this.

864
00:34:12,552 --> 00:34:15,553
So the last time
he went out for a smoke,

865
00:34:15,555 --> 00:34:18,957
I got out and I just took off.

866
00:34:18,959 --> 00:34:22,193
I couldn't see.
It was so dark.

867
00:34:22,195 --> 00:34:23,628
And branches kept cutting me,

868
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:25,363
but I knew
I had to keep running.

869
00:34:25,365 --> 00:34:28,466
Mr. Stone, when they called
you, what did they want?

870
00:34:28,468 --> 00:34:30,068
$3 million.

871
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:33,038
Said it had to be in cash,
nonsequential bills.

872
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,808
I'm sorry that I didn't
tell you before. I...

873
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:39,411
I was doing
what they said.

874
00:34:39,413 --> 00:34:42,480
I was doing everything
I could to get that money.

875
00:34:42,482 --> 00:34:45,383
I know you were.
I know.

876
00:34:45,385 --> 00:34:48,620
We need to get over to that tent
where you were kept,

877
00:34:48,622 --> 00:34:50,388
go over it
before it rains.

878
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:52,290
They're gonna take you
to the hospital,

879
00:34:52,292 --> 00:34:54,459
get you checked out. Would
it be all right if we came by

880
00:34:54,461 --> 00:34:56,428
and asked
a few more questions?

881
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:58,463
Whatever you need.

882
00:35:04,538 --> 00:35:06,471
Hey. Campsite's this way.

883
00:35:06,473 --> 00:35:08,106
Yeah. And you're
welcome to inspect it.

884
00:35:08,108 --> 00:35:09,941
I'm sure Mrs. Stone's
done a really good job

885
00:35:09,943 --> 00:35:11,376
of sprinkling
bread crumbs there.

886
00:35:11,378 --> 00:35:13,278
You might find the remnants
of a chapati

887
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,213
to support her absurd fiction.

888
00:35:15,215 --> 00:35:16,125
You think she's lying
about something?

889
00:35:16,126 --> 00:35:17,312
I think she's lying
about everything.

890
00:35:17,336 --> 00:35:18,884
I'm still quite certain

891
00:35:18,885 --> 00:35:20,852
Dennis Karig is the man
we saw in that video.

892
00:35:20,854 --> 00:35:22,087
She's covering for him.

893
00:35:22,089 --> 00:35:23,321
And why would she do that?

894
00:35:23,323 --> 00:35:24,789
'Cause he's covering for her.

895
00:35:25,759 --> 00:35:27,225
She kidnapped herself.

896
00:35:37,031 --> 00:35:39,498
Something's been gnawing at me.

897
00:35:39,834 --> 00:35:42,602
You know, Beth Stone's
imaginary bogeymen

898
00:35:42,604 --> 00:35:44,036
aren't properly represented
here.

899
00:35:44,038 --> 00:35:46,038
The co-captains
of the Karachi Dragons

900
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,708
are as likely as any Pakistanis
to have been involved,

901
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:50,610
so I thought they could stand in
for now.

902
00:35:50,612 --> 00:35:53,012
You can stop mocking her story.
She's lying.

903
00:35:53,014 --> 00:35:54,480
I'm sold.
And yet

904
00:35:54,482 --> 00:35:55,748
you won't join me
in pouring scorn

905
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:57,583
on her racist tale of woe.

906
00:35:57,585 --> 00:35:59,752
Well, there could be
a lot of reasons

907
00:35:59,754 --> 00:36:02,421
why Beth is covering for Karig
and not in on it.

908
00:36:02,423 --> 00:36:04,891
Uh, he could have
something on her.

909
00:36:04,893 --> 00:36:07,360
Maybe it's Stockholm syndrome.

910
00:36:07,362 --> 00:36:10,329
Maybe. But I think I've devised
a better theory.

911
00:36:10,331 --> 00:36:11,998
You'll recall that
Aaron Stone

912
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,666
recently visited
a family lawyer

913
00:36:13,668 --> 00:36:15,168
and that he
and Beth are set

914
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:17,036
to celebrate
their tenth anniversary.

915
00:36:17,038 --> 00:36:18,337
Yeah?

916
00:36:18,339 --> 00:36:20,039
But while I'm not privy
to the details

917
00:36:20,041 --> 00:36:22,441
of their prenuptial agreement,
I'd not at all be surprised

918
00:36:22,443 --> 00:36:25,778
if it were about
to lapse.

919
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:27,613
So, if Aaron
was considering a divorce,

920
00:36:27,615 --> 00:36:30,483
Beth had financial motive,
just like Karig did.

921
00:36:30,485 --> 00:36:32,685
Instead of getting a
fraction of their estate,

922
00:36:32,687 --> 00:36:36,022
she could be in line
for as much as half.

923
00:36:36,024 --> 00:36:38,758
But everyone thinks
that this CGI software

924
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,560
is worth tens of millions.

925
00:36:40,562 --> 00:36:42,962
So why ask for a lousy
$3 million to split?

926
00:36:42,964 --> 00:36:44,330
Because Aaron couldn't pay it.

927
00:36:44,332 --> 00:36:46,165
The point is not to score
a ransom.

928
00:36:46,167 --> 00:36:48,868
It's to shame Aaron
into running out the clock

929
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:50,536
on their prenuptial agreement.

930
00:36:50,538 --> 00:36:53,539
Oh. I guess it
would be pretty awful

931
00:36:53,541 --> 00:36:57,410
if he left her after she'd been
through this horrible ordeal.

932
00:36:57,412 --> 00:36:59,378
Social suicide.
Hmm.

933
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:01,180
It's a
good theory.

934
00:37:01,182 --> 00:37:02,848
It's just
a theory.

935
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:04,750
Married couples, Watson.

936
00:37:04,752 --> 00:37:07,119
How often have their messes
robbed you

937
00:37:07,121 --> 00:37:09,355
- of your precious sleep?
- And to think,

938
00:37:09,357 --> 00:37:12,992
I recently suggested that
the captain join their ranks.

939
00:37:12,994 --> 00:37:15,761
You what?

940
00:37:15,763 --> 00:37:19,265
I suggested he tie the knot.

941
00:37:20,735 --> 00:37:21,968
I-I thought it a solution

942
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:23,769
to Paige's insurance problems.

943
00:37:23,771 --> 00:37:25,905
Right,
come on. Let's have it.

944
00:37:25,907 --> 00:37:28,741
And, remember, it's cricket.
So arm straight.

945
00:37:28,743 --> 00:37:31,177
I-In a minute. I'm still trying
to picture you arguing

946
00:37:31,179 --> 00:37:32,945
in favor of marriage.

947
00:37:32,947 --> 00:37:35,047
Yes, I know. I have spoken out
against it in the past.

948
00:37:35,049 --> 00:37:37,016
Only if you count calling it
a fiendish plot

949
00:37:37,018 --> 00:37:38,618
to subvert human biology,
independence,

950
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:40,453
and happiness.
Yeah, exactly.

951
00:37:40,455 --> 00:37:43,522
But in this rare case, it might
be mutually beneficial--

952
00:37:43,524 --> 00:37:45,358
good for his health
and hers.

953
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,026
Studies have shown
that there are health benefits

954
00:37:47,028 --> 00:37:49,095
for men who reside in a state
of sexless antagonism

955
00:37:49,097 --> 00:37:50,496
with a life partner.

956
00:37:50,498 --> 00:37:53,833
Ah. Then you'll live to be 100.

957
00:37:59,474 --> 00:38:01,107
Her breasts, Watson.

958
00:38:01,109 --> 00:38:03,376
What do Paige's breasts have
to do with anything?

959
00:38:03,378 --> 00:38:05,611
No, not-not Paige's.
Beth Stone's.

960
00:38:05,613 --> 00:38:07,146
You saw them earlier.

961
00:38:07,148 --> 00:38:08,481
I wasn't really looking at them.

962
00:38:08,483 --> 00:38:09,715
Well, you should have.

963
00:38:09,717 --> 00:38:12,518
They're her undoing.

964
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,287
We wanted to speak
to you 'cause we didn't find

965
00:38:14,289 --> 00:38:17,290
any physical evidence
in Great Kills Park.

966
00:38:17,292 --> 00:38:19,492
Nothing to suggest
anyone other than Beth

967
00:38:19,494 --> 00:38:21,927
made camp in those woods.

968
00:38:21,929 --> 00:38:22,800
I don't understand.

969
00:38:22,824 --> 00:38:24,153
Before she was abducted,

970
00:38:24,154 --> 00:38:26,154
you were considering
divorce, Mr. Stone.

971
00:38:26,155 --> 00:38:27,755
I would file
right away.

972
00:38:27,757 --> 00:38:31,058
No. No, that is not true.
I w... I was not...

973
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:33,127
We know you saw
a lawyer about your prenup.

974
00:38:33,129 --> 00:38:36,353
We don't know when it expires,
but ten years is a nice round number.

975
00:38:36,354 --> 00:38:38,166
Your upcoming
anniversary was the motivation

976
00:38:38,167 --> 00:38:40,067
for this entire charade,
was it not?

977
00:38:40,069 --> 00:38:41,083
What are you talking about?

978
00:38:41,107 --> 00:38:42,738
We're talking
about you trying to guilt

979
00:38:42,739 --> 00:38:44,839
your husband into sticking
around long enough

980
00:38:44,841 --> 00:38:46,340
for the prenup
to lapse.

981
00:38:46,342 --> 00:38:47,942
That's insane.

982
00:38:47,944 --> 00:38:50,745
Aaron and I
love each other.

983
00:38:50,747 --> 00:38:52,747
Even if we didn't,

984
00:38:52,749 --> 00:38:54,448
we're broke.

985
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:57,118
What's the difference
between five percent of nothing

986
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:59,820
and... a whole lot more
of nothing?

987
00:38:59,822 --> 00:39:01,055
But it wouldn't be nothing.

988
00:39:01,057 --> 00:39:03,090
It would be a fair share
of your assets,

989
00:39:03,092 --> 00:39:06,227
including the rights
to Dennis Karig's software.

990
00:39:06,229 --> 00:39:08,696
And that's a pretty
substantial motive to...

991
00:39:08,698 --> 00:39:11,532
buy yourself some time,
earn a little sympathy...

992
00:39:11,534 --> 00:39:14,168
Maybe you were hoping
that faking your own kidnapping

993
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:16,370
would save your marriage.
Maybe you really do love him.

994
00:39:16,372 --> 00:39:18,372
But we think
that it was about the money.

995
00:39:18,374 --> 00:39:20,474
You and Dennis were greedy,
so you struck a deal.

996
00:39:20,476 --> 00:39:23,944
I can't believe you people.
I was taken.

997
00:39:23,946 --> 00:39:26,514
Yes, by two Pakistani men.
We've heard your, um,

998
00:39:26,516 --> 00:39:28,449
bigoted fantasia.

999
00:39:29,352 --> 00:39:31,218
Do these look fake to you?

1000
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:32,687
No.
But they were self-inflicted.

1001
00:39:32,689 --> 00:39:34,288
As was your suntan.
Which has faded.

1002
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:35,556
It was positively glowing

1003
00:39:35,558 --> 00:39:37,258
on the news
yesterday.

1004
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:41,234
Your arms were covered, your face
was muddied, but this area was exposed.

1005
00:39:41,235 --> 00:39:42,297
You told us

1006
00:39:42,298 --> 00:39:44,231
you were locked in a cabin
until just a few days ago.

1007
00:39:44,233 --> 00:39:47,234
And then, in the middle of the
night, you were taken to a tent.

1008
00:39:47,236 --> 00:39:50,471
So tell us, when exactly
did you find time to sunbathe?

1009
00:39:50,473 --> 00:39:51,906
I think it was between visits

1010
00:39:51,908 --> 00:39:53,908
from your co-conspirator,
Mr. Karig.

1011
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:56,143
Mr. Stone,
if you want

1012
00:39:56,145 --> 00:39:58,345
to step outside for a minute,
we're gonna invite

1013
00:39:58,347 --> 00:40:01,816
an assistant district attorney
to sit in that chair.

1014
00:40:01,818 --> 00:40:04,051
You didn't
pull the trigger

1015
00:40:04,053 --> 00:40:05,553
which killed
Kenneth Tolan,

1016
00:40:05,555 --> 00:40:08,189
so you get first crack
at a plea deal.

1017
00:40:08,191 --> 00:40:10,825
It's time to betray
your other partner.

1018
00:40:16,099 --> 00:40:18,265
They'll be done
in 20 minutes.

1019
00:40:18,267 --> 00:40:20,768
Have a car ready to transport
her to Central Booking,

1020
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:22,703
and then...

1021
00:40:26,375 --> 00:40:27,641
Did I forget a lunch?

1022
00:40:27,643 --> 00:40:29,009
No, I arranged
one for you.

1023
00:40:29,011 --> 00:40:30,711
Come here.

1024
00:40:30,713 --> 00:40:32,279
You did what?

1025
00:40:32,281 --> 00:40:34,215
I, um... I, uh...

1026
00:40:34,217 --> 00:40:35,983
I took the liberty
of talking to Paige.

1027
00:40:35,985 --> 00:40:39,587
We, um... we discussed
her reservations about marriage.

1028
00:40:41,858 --> 00:40:45,092
Look, I don't know why you've
decided to get in the middle

1029
00:40:45,094 --> 00:40:46,527
of this, but, I got to say...

1030
00:40:46,529 --> 00:40:48,195
I managed to lower her defenses.

1031
00:40:49,632 --> 00:40:51,866
I've taken it as far as I can.
But at some point

1032
00:40:51,868 --> 00:40:53,868
in the process,
uh, your absence became,

1033
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:56,270
you know, quite limiting.

1034
00:40:56,272 --> 00:40:58,105
What process?
She told me

1035
00:40:58,107 --> 00:40:59,573
about the weekend getaway
that you have planned.

1036
00:40:59,575 --> 00:41:05,212
Um, sounded like a
excellent opportunity to...

1037
00:41:05,214 --> 00:41:06,881
elope.

1038
00:41:06,883 --> 00:41:08,349

00:41:08,351 --> 00:41:11,685
