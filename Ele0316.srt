1
00:00:19,453 --> 00:00:21,420
Now, with text
deposit, you can manage

2
00:00:21,422 --> 00:00:24,023
your accounts from
literally anywhere.

3
00:00:24,025 --> 00:00:26,291
You can bank on it.
You can

4
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:29,495
bank on us...
Sequoia Liberty.

5
00:00:31,032 --> 00:00:33,032
Okay, yes, they do
sound similar.

6
00:00:33,034 --> 00:00:34,666
They're
the same song.

7
00:00:34,668 --> 00:00:36,535
Someone stole my song

8
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:38,737
and turned it into a jingle.

9
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:44,109
You said you never
played this at a show?

10
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:46,311
I have a little studio space
in Alphabet City.

11
00:00:46,313 --> 00:00:47,813
I do everything there.

12
00:00:47,815 --> 00:00:50,416
But it's soundproofed.
When I'm writing,

13
00:00:50,418 --> 00:00:53,252
I work alone.

14
00:00:54,422 --> 00:00:57,756
Could you just
excuse me for a moment?

15
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:03,295
Watson.

16
00:01:03,297 --> 00:01:06,298
- What are you doing?
- Having worked through the night

17
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,500
at various pursuits, I am now
attempting to fall asleep.

18
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:10,469
Obviously.

19
00:01:10,471 --> 00:01:13,338
You familiar with the surrealist
works of Salvador Dalí?

20
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,140
Yes, of course
I am familiar with Dalí.

21
00:01:15,142 --> 00:01:17,376
Well, we share the same
opinion of sleep.

22
00:01:17,378 --> 00:01:19,778
Namely that it is
a waste of time.

23
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,613
There may exist,
however, a moment

24
00:01:21,615 --> 00:01:23,282
at the boundary between
working and sleeping

25
00:01:23,284 --> 00:01:25,484
which holds some
utility. He would use

26
00:01:25,486 --> 00:01:26,819
a similar method
to catch himself

27
00:01:26,821 --> 00:01:28,587
the instant he fell asleep

28
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:31,256
and record glimpses
into his subconscious mind.

29
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:33,292
And I'm trying to train
my own subconscious

30
00:01:33,294 --> 00:01:35,828
to solve more
impenetrable problems.

31
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:38,163
Though I do realize
that from the outside it seems

32
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:40,799
no more pragmatic that a visit
to the Delphic Oracle.

33
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:42,534
From the outside,
it makes a lot of noise.

34
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:44,269
I'm meeting with
a client downstairs.

35
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:46,138
A woman, no? If she's
the one playing

36
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,873
the guitar, you might
want to suggest that a tuning

37
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:50,309
is in order.
Does her case intrigue?

38
00:01:50,311 --> 00:01:52,411
Do you require
my assistance?

39
00:01:52,413 --> 00:01:54,780
I require a little quiet.
That's all.

40
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:58,584
I shall continue my experiment
on a higher floor.

41
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:11,797
Captain.

42
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:15,234
Hey, I've got two detectives
from the 3-5 here.

43
00:02:15,236 --> 00:02:17,703
They want to talk to you about
a homicide they're working.

44
00:02:17,705 --> 00:02:20,439
Yes, of course.
Watson is otherwise engaged,

45
00:02:20,441 --> 00:02:22,374
but I can be there
in about 30 minutes.

46
00:02:22,376 --> 00:02:25,210
I'll see you then.

47
00:02:26,881 --> 00:02:29,414
Holmes, this is Detective Demps

48
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:31,383
- and McShane.
- Gentlemen.

49
00:02:31,385 --> 00:02:34,386
Heard a lot about you
the last couple years.

50
00:02:34,388 --> 00:02:36,288
Despite my best efforts,

51
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:38,357
I assure you.

52
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:40,492
How can I help you?

53
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:42,194
Maria Gutierrez.

54
00:02:42,196 --> 00:02:44,363
She went missing
a little over three years ago.

55
00:02:44,365 --> 00:02:45,731
Last week her remains
were discovered

56
00:02:45,733 --> 00:02:47,399
by a city worker in a vacant lot

57
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:50,202
next to Thomas Jefferson Park.
Erosion had partially

58
00:02:50,204 --> 00:02:51,737
- uncovered the grave.
- M.E. said

59
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:54,840
she died from blunt force
trauma to the head.

60
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:57,442
Mm-hmm.

61
00:02:57,444 --> 00:03:00,479
Yeah.

62
00:03:00,481 --> 00:03:03,749
Ms. Gutierrez worked
in a custodial profession,

63
00:03:03,751 --> 00:03:06,818
night shifts,
mostly.

64
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,388
You, uh, you saying
you knew her?

65
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,256
Certainly not.

66
00:03:11,258 --> 00:03:13,492
The hair on her right forearm
is a distinctly lighter shade

67
00:03:13,494 --> 00:03:15,928
than that on her left. Um,
ammonia and bleach, of course,

68
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,497
whiten body hair. Her natural
hair color resumes at a line

69
00:03:18,499 --> 00:03:20,365
where one imagines
she wore rubber gloves.

70
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:22,935
Her skin tone is also
several shades lighter

71
00:03:22,937 --> 00:03:24,503
than that of her
immediate relatives,

72
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:26,338
indicating a more
nocturnal lifestyle.

73
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,575
No, no way.
You had to know her.

74
00:03:29,577 --> 00:03:33,277
You indicated that you were familiar
with my methods.

75
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:34,513
Yeah, well, we heard

76
00:03:34,515 --> 00:03:36,315
you knew a few tricks.

77
00:03:36,317 --> 00:03:38,417
Not tricks.

78
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:40,586
You sure you don't know her?

79
00:03:40,588 --> 00:03:42,654
Never laid eyes
on her before?

80
00:03:49,964 --> 00:03:52,231
This is not a consultation,
it's an interrogation.

81
00:03:56,604 --> 00:03:59,471
So, would you like to tell me
why you consider me a suspect?

82
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:00,706
Mm-hmm?

83
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:03,408
We found this
in the victim's purse.

84
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,244
It's a receipt
from a coffee shop

85
00:04:05,246 --> 00:04:07,379
two blocks
from your residence,

86
00:04:07,381 --> 00:04:08,947
dated the day
that Maria disappeared.

87
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:11,583
Want to tell us again
how you don't know her?

88
00:04:21,462 --> 00:04:22,828
I know what you're thinking.

89
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:25,430
S. Holmes...
that could be a lot of people.

90
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,766
Maybe there's a Steve Holmes
out there, or a Sally.

91
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:30,402
But we showed it to our
handwriting expert at Q-DOC.

92
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:32,938
I could have
saved you the trouble.

93
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,841
I'm the author of that note.
There is no doubt.

94
00:04:35,843 --> 00:04:38,977
Oh, then you lied when you said
you didn't know Maria Gutierrez.

95
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:41,480
I did not lie.

96
00:04:41,482 --> 00:04:43,548
I do not recall her face

97
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,983
and I have no memory of writing

98
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:48,420
- to her.
- You saying you have amnesia?

99
00:04:48,422 --> 00:04:50,322
Of a sort.

100
00:04:50,324 --> 00:04:52,958
During the period
in question... late 2011,

101
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,493
when Ms. Gutierrez disappeared...

102
00:04:54,495 --> 00:04:57,629
I was quite addicted
to narcotics.

103
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:59,431
A great variety
of them,

104
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:00,699
in fact.

105
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:03,635
Blackouts were not uncommon.

106
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:05,404
And on this night in particular,

107
00:05:05,406 --> 00:05:08,473
the 7th of December, 2011?

108
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:11,410
I do not believe
I could be much clearer.

109
00:05:11,412 --> 00:05:13,812
I have no recollection
of this woman

110
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:15,881
or anything that might
have happened to her.

111
00:05:15,883 --> 00:05:17,482
Guys,

112
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:19,451
- it's a note.
- Received

113
00:05:19,453 --> 00:05:21,787
by our Vic the day she
disappeared, one your consultant

114
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:23,555
just admitted he wrote.

115
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:25,557
She was a cleaner,
maybe he wanted to hire her.

116
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:27,559
Before we came here, you said
this was a waste of time,

117
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:28,827
you knew your guy.

118
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,062
I do.

119
00:05:30,064 --> 00:05:31,897
Did you know about
the blackouts?

120
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:37,636
You asked for five minutes,
I gave you five minutes.

121
00:05:37,638 --> 00:05:39,805
If anything
else occurs

122
00:05:39,807 --> 00:05:43,408
to my consultant,
I'm sure he'll be in touch.

123
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:16,041
Hey. I realized

124
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:18,110
I needed one of these to cook.

125
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,781
What's wrong?

126
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,388
Had I not deprived myself
of sleep these last few nights,

127
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:32,457
perhaps I would have realized
what was happening sooner.

128
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:33,692
Captain should have told you.

129
00:06:33,694 --> 00:06:35,026
It would have
been indefensible

130
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:37,729
for him to show me
special consideration.

131
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:40,632
But he has every confidence
that the detectives

132
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:42,100
- are wasting their time.
- They are.

133
00:06:42,102 --> 00:06:45,036
I wrote that note.

134
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:46,805
I was without

135
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:50,642
a phone at the time.
I used street urchins

136
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:52,778
to bring my correspondence
to and fro.

137
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,479
And that makes you a killer?

138
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:57,649
I feel confident

139
00:06:57,651 --> 00:06:59,718
that the moral maths
of my character

140
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,620
would have prevented me
from committing a murder

141
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:03,422
even in the most
altered of states.

142
00:07:03,424 --> 00:07:05,424
However,

143
00:07:05,426 --> 00:07:06,958
some of the drugs
I used during that period

144
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,661
made me quite paranoid.

145
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:11,730
Others caused hallucinations.

146
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:17,068
The unfortunate truth is

147
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,638
that however improbable
certain things may be

148
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:23,141
with respect to this crime,

149
00:07:23,143 --> 00:07:25,577
nothing's impossible.

150
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:29,147
It was a few months after Irene.

151
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:31,817
You thought she was dead.
You were using more.

152
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:33,652
It began as practical attempt

153
00:07:33,654 --> 00:07:37,522
to improve my mental horsepower.

154
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:40,725
I expected to find connections
that others had missed.

155
00:07:40,727 --> 00:07:42,527
But as my failures mounted,

156
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:44,830
so too did my cravings.

157
00:07:44,832 --> 00:07:48,099
And distraction turned
to crass dependence.

158
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:51,570
And so began
the downward spiral.

159
00:07:51,572 --> 00:07:54,606
You know we're gonna
figure this out.

160
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:57,175
Well, I've been asked
not to interfere.

161
00:07:57,177 --> 00:07:59,945
You say that like you
haven't heard it before.

162
00:07:59,947 --> 00:08:01,947
Never been a suspect before.

163
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:04,182
Besides, we're at
a grave disadvantage.

164
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:06,551
Ordinarily, the police would
share their files with us.

165
00:08:06,553 --> 00:08:08,019
We'd have access to evidence,
we'd have access

166
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:11,690
to the victim's remains.

167
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:14,192
I can't even say how I knew her.

168
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:16,127
Then that's where we'll start.

169
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:17,729
Watson...

170
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:19,798
We know her name.
You said you saw pictures

171
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,600
of her with her family.
I'll talk to them.

172
00:08:21,602 --> 00:08:23,602
I promised the captain.

173
00:08:23,604 --> 00:08:26,204
I didn't.

174
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:29,708
You stay here, dig into your
files, see if her name pops up.

175
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:32,277
You think I knew her
through my work.

176
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:33,812
How do you
know anyone?

177
00:08:33,814 --> 00:08:35,714
Maybe she wanted to hire you

178
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:37,816
or she was a witness
in a case you were working.

179
00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:39,684
Or maybe Gregson was right...
you just needed someone

180
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:41,953
to clean this place.
Whatever the connection is,

181
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:45,290
you did not kill that woman.

182
00:08:54,668 --> 00:08:58,236
Uh, Mrs. Sandoval?
Hi, I'm Joan Watson.

183
00:08:58,238 --> 00:08:59,971
I know who you are.

184
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:02,807
Um, the detectives
from the 35th told you

185
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:05,210
- about me.
- And your partner.

186
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:07,946
I am so sorry for your loss.

187
00:09:07,948 --> 00:09:11,783
I can imagine how difficult
this week has been for you, but

188
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:13,151
I promise you I am
only here because

189
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:15,053
I want to help
find the person who killed

190
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,722
- your sister.
- I don't want to talk to you.

191
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,824
Please, do you have any idea
how Maria and Sherlock

192
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:21,793
would have known each other?

193
00:09:21,795 --> 00:09:24,896
What do you mean how they
would have known each other?

194
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,232
He was going through
a difficult time,

195
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:28,800
he's having trouble remembering.

196
00:09:28,802 --> 00:09:31,336
I would want to forget
killing Maria, too.

197
00:09:31,338 --> 00:09:33,605
- Mrs. Sandoval...
- No.

198
00:09:33,607 --> 00:09:36,808
You ask me how they knew
each other. I don't know.

199
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,777
She was<i> indocumentado.</i>

200
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:40,178
Illegal.

201
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:43,348
She stayed out of trouble,
she-she did her work.

202
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,684
Went to church.

203
00:09:45,686 --> 00:09:47,852
But in the end,
it didn't matter.

204
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:49,955
Trouble found her.

205
00:09:49,957 --> 00:09:52,123
Please, don't

206
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,192
come here again.

207
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:00,765
<i>All right, check the</i>

208
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,801
stitching, get a feel for it.

209
00:10:02,803 --> 00:10:04,135
Huh? Nice, right?

210
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:05,837
You're not gonna
find quality like that on

211
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,639
Canal Street.

212
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:10,208
What, you don't like the color?

213
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,911
You want to see it in red?
I got it in red.

214
00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:18,717
Oh, ladies, come on,
come on, don't

215
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:21,653
be like that. Hey, I got
a special going on today...

216
00:10:21,655 --> 00:10:23,054
two for one.

217
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:26,891
What, do you got a date
with Godzilla or something?

218
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:29,828
Those women are from
China, not Japan.

219
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,896
Though the racism worked,
either way.

220
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:36,301
Don't suppose I can
interest you in a handbag?

221
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:38,303
That depends. Does your supplier
always spell âPradaâ

222
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:39,671
with two Ds?

223
00:10:45,912 --> 00:10:47,912
Been a long time.

224
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:50,915
Not long enough, Oscar.
Not nearly.

225
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:53,952
But I need your help
with something.

226
00:10:55,789 --> 00:10:59,024
I can't believe
it's been three years.

227
00:10:59,026 --> 00:11:00,692
Yes, well,

228
00:11:00,694 --> 00:11:03,895
time flies
when you're on heroin.

229
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:07,298
You look good.

230
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:11,002
You clean?

231
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:13,238
I am.

232
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,840
Good for you. Hey!

233
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:18,710
Hey! Beat it!
Yeah, scram!

234
00:11:18,712 --> 00:11:21,780
We had a good
thing going on.

235
00:11:21,782 --> 00:11:24,015
- We were a good team.
- Actually,

236
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:26,885
we were not a team.

237
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:28,887
I was a consumer of narcotics,
and you were someone

238
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:31,022
with access
to pharmaceutical-grade product.

239
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,824
You don't call that a team?

240
00:11:32,826 --> 00:11:34,826
I do not.

241
00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:37,829
Yes, you spent a good deal
of time at my home,

242
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:39,431
but that was
because you were prone

243
00:11:39,433 --> 00:11:40,832
to rendering yourself
unconscious.

244
00:11:43,003 --> 00:11:45,303
How did it all go so wrong?

245
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:47,305
Well, if memory serves, Oscar,
you let yourself in one day

246
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:48,973
and made off with
several thousand dollars' worth

247
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:51,976
of rare books
and computer equipment.

248
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:58,149
Well, you said
you needed my help?

249
00:11:58,151 --> 00:12:01,886
You may recall, in the weeks
prior to our parting ways,

250
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:05,256
my drug use
became quite profound.

251
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:09,794
Well, the price was some equally
profound holes in my memory.

252
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:13,898
And no one spent more time with
me during that period than you.

253
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,836
I would like to know
if the name Maria Gutierrez

254
00:12:17,838 --> 00:12:19,971
means anything to you.

255
00:12:22,743 --> 00:12:24,743
There's evidence to suggest
I had plans to meet with her

256
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:26,745
- in December of 2011...
- Sherlock,

257
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:29,280
of course I remember her. Maria?

258
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:32,217
From the circus.
Dark hair, big...

259
00:12:32,219 --> 00:12:35,253
No, no, no. Th-That's Marena.
She was one of my paramours.

260
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:38,256
Maria, Oscar.
Maria Gutierrez.

261
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:40,291
Do you remember the name or not?

262
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:42,927
Look, man, I'm sorry.

263
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:46,531
You're not the only one who has
trouble remembering those days.

264
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:52,337
Ah, well, this was fun.
Catching up.

265
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:54,339
I got to go.

266
00:12:54,341 --> 00:12:57,475
Maybe we can do it again
sometime.

267
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:10,221
- Watson.
- I just got home. Where are you?

268
00:13:10,223 --> 00:13:12,390
I thought a constitutional
might jog my memory.

269
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:14,492
It did not.

270
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:15,894
How did you do?

271
00:13:15,896 --> 00:13:17,862
To be honest, not good.

272
00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:19,931
The guys at the 35th told
Maria's family

273
00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:22,167
and friends about me.
No one was in a talking mood.

274
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:24,869
My files were equally fruitless.

275
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:27,872
If Ms. Gutierrez was connected
to a crime I was investigating,

276
00:13:27,874 --> 00:13:29,407
I failed to make a note of it.

277
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:32,243
Is it possible
this is some sort of frame-up?

278
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:35,246
The body was so well hidden,
it took three years to discover.

279
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:37,882
If it was a frame-up,
it was a very poor one.

280
00:13:37,884 --> 00:13:39,884
You know, I've been reading up
on articles

281
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:41,920
from when she disappeared
in 2011.

282
00:13:41,922 --> 00:13:43,955
I know it's not the same
as looking at police files,

283
00:13:43,957 --> 00:13:46,891
but something jumped out at me.

284
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:49,994
She put a lot of hours in
at her church's soup kitchen.

285
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:51,830
You think
she may have come across

286
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:53,832
some shady characters there?

287
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:56,467
Marcus is running down a list
of their frequent fliers.

288
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:59,370
- You brought the detective into this?
- Of course I did.

289
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:01,940
He's gonna let us know
if anyone has a record.

290
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:03,942
I'm almost home.
We'll discuss the matter

291
00:14:03,944 --> 00:14:07,245
in person.

292
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:14,252
Sherlock Holmes?

293
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,557
Do I know you?

294
00:14:31,004 --> 00:14:33,004
Let's go. Come on. We got to go.
Come on.

295
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:34,505
Let's go!

296
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:51,222
You know, I'd have
an easier time examining you

297
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:54,626
- if you would put down your phone.
- I imagine you would. Fortunately

298
00:14:54,628 --> 00:14:56,995
for the both of us, my wounds
are entirely superficial.

299
00:14:56,997 --> 00:14:59,497
- There could be internal damage.
- There is not.

300
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:02,000
Well, if you're in such great
shape, why did you come here?

301
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:05,370
I enjoy hospitals.

302
00:15:05,372 --> 00:15:07,405
Especially in the middle
of the night.

303
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:08,690
Doctor, if my ears
do not deceive me,

304
00:15:08,691 --> 00:15:09,974
a real patient
has just arrived.

305
00:15:09,976 --> 00:15:12,977
A man with a lightbulb
in an unfortunate place.

306
00:15:12,979 --> 00:15:15,680
- Right.
- Hey, we need you.

307
00:15:15,682 --> 00:15:18,049
Foreign body impaction. Bad one.

308
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:19,684
If you require
assistance,

309
00:15:19,686 --> 00:15:23,221
you will not find smaller or
steadier hands than Watson's.

310
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:30,061
So, are you gonna call
the police, or should I?

311
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:32,297
- There's no need.
- You were targeted.

312
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:34,499
One of the men
called you by name.

313
00:15:34,501 --> 00:15:36,334
And it can't be a coincidence
that you were jumped

314
00:15:36,336 --> 00:15:38,336
the same day you were questioned
about a homicide.

315
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:40,972
I think it is a coincidence.
Though I do not disagree

316
00:15:40,974 --> 00:15:42,507
that the two events
are connected.

317
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:45,209
Does the name Prentice Gutierrez
ring a bell?

318
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:47,178
Maria's brother.
I saw his name mentioned

319
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,479
in one of the articles I read.

320
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:50,515
I couldn't track him down today.

321
00:15:50,517 --> 00:15:53,518
Probably because he was busy
planning an ambush.

322
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,386
How do you know
he was one of the...

323
00:15:57,057 --> 00:15:59,390
There are few circumstances
more amenable

324
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:01,659
to picking a man's
pocket than a thrashing.

325
00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:03,728
It is better to be the
thrasher, obviously,

326
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,463
but beggars can't be choosers.

327
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,532
An Internet search
of Mr. Gutierrez

328
00:16:07,534 --> 00:16:10,335
revealed nothing more than
his connection to his sister.

329
00:16:10,337 --> 00:16:13,638
But a police intranet search,
however...

330
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:19,410
He was arrested for burgling
a home in November of 2011.

331
00:16:19,412 --> 00:16:21,612
That's just one month
before Maria disappeared.

332
00:16:21,614 --> 00:16:25,083
He insisted to anyone who would
listen that he was innocent.

333
00:16:25,085 --> 00:16:27,285
And you posited earlier
that Maria wished to hire me

334
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:28,319
as a detective.

335
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:30,321
She believed him.

336
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:33,491
You were supposed to find
the person who really did it.

337
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:37,362
Prentice.

338
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,498
I know you?

339
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,600
We had a brief
physical relationship.

340
00:16:42,602 --> 00:16:44,369
Perhaps this will jog
your memory.

341
00:16:45,739 --> 00:16:49,107
I lost this a couple
of days ago. Thanks.

342
00:16:49,109 --> 00:16:51,576
Mr. Gutierrez,
I bear you no ill will.

343
00:16:51,578 --> 00:16:53,411
You learned my name
from the detectives

344
00:16:53,413 --> 00:16:55,279
investigating Maria's murder,

345
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:57,348
and you took matters
into your own hands.

346
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:00,218
I don't know
what you're talking about.

347
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,319
Of course
you do.

348
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:02,587
Just like you know
you're on parole

349
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:05,123
for that burglary charge
in 2011.

350
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,593
An assault charge could violate
you back to prison.

351
00:17:07,695 --> 00:17:10,595
It'd be worth it, though, wouldn't it?
Hurting the man who hurt Maria?

352
00:17:10,597 --> 00:17:14,365
The problem is, neither of us
can say with any certainty

353
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:16,401
that I am that man.

354
00:17:16,403 --> 00:17:18,403
Right.
Because you don't remember.

355
00:17:18,405 --> 00:17:20,438
Or at least that's the story
you tried to sell

356
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,739
to my other sister.

357
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:23,307
The burglary.
You said you didn't do it.

358
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:25,343
You got any idea who did?

359
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:26,912
What the hell does that have
to do with anything?

360
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:28,012
We're investigating

361
00:17:28,014 --> 00:17:30,815
the possibility that Maria
wanted help finding that person.

362
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:33,418
He would've had motive
to stop her.

363
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:36,421
You stay away from me
and my family.

364
00:17:36,423 --> 00:17:38,756
Both of you.

365
00:17:42,128 --> 00:17:44,128
We'll go back to the station.
We'll look into burglaries

366
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,530
that were committed
around that time.

367
00:17:45,532 --> 00:17:48,666
We might be able to find
a suspect without his help.

368
00:17:54,374 --> 00:17:56,474
So, we're onto something,
though, aren't we?

369
00:17:56,476 --> 00:17:58,142
You know who committed
the burglary.

370
00:17:58,144 --> 00:17:59,777
You have until I finish
replacing these brake pads.

371
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:01,779
If you're still here
when I turn around,

372
00:18:01,781 --> 00:18:03,249
I'm the one who's gonna
be calling the cops.

373
00:18:03,251 --> 00:18:04,251
Mr. Gutierrez...

374
00:18:04,451 --> 00:18:06,818
- Come on. Let's go.
- It occurs to me, you know,

375
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:09,087
that any one of these tools

376
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:11,422
could've been the end of me
last night.

377
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:12,690
But you attacked me

378
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:15,493
with fists
and with booted feet.

379
00:18:15,495 --> 00:18:18,696
So you didn't want to kill me.
You just wanted to hurt me.

380
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:20,731
Do you want to do it again?

381
00:18:21,668 --> 00:18:23,267
What are you
talking about?

382
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:24,569
I'm talking
about reciprocity.

383
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:26,471
I'm talking
about quid pro quo.

384
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:31,843
If you submit to my questions...

385
00:18:31,845 --> 00:18:35,279
I'll submit to a blow
from this wrench.

386
00:18:39,486 --> 00:18:43,654
You're not certain
that I hurt Maria, are you?

387
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:46,357
If you're open to suggestions,

388
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:47,825
I offer my hand.

389
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:53,264
Come on. You're gonna break
any number of bones.

390
00:18:53,266 --> 00:18:54,665
The pain's gonna be
excruciating.

391
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:55,500
Sherlock...

392
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,447
I did the burglary.

393
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:11,315
I did it.

394
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:13,384
And Maria knew it. I told her.
So you're wrong

395
00:19:13,386 --> 00:19:17,388
about her wanting you to find
the person who really did it.

396
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:19,457
If she wanted your help,

397
00:19:19,459 --> 00:19:22,460
it didn't have anything to do
with that.

398
00:19:22,462 --> 00:19:24,295
Can you think

399
00:19:24,297 --> 00:19:26,430
of anyone who would've wanted
to hurt her?

400
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:32,603
You know she cleaned, right?

401
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:35,573
The year she went
missing, there was a guy

402
00:19:35,575 --> 00:19:38,176
she worked for who owned
a couple of buildings in Queens,

403
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:40,645
and one of them was being rented
by a-a councilman

404
00:19:40,647 --> 00:19:42,580
who was running for reelection.

405
00:19:42,582 --> 00:19:44,215
Uh, Barclay.

406
00:19:44,217 --> 00:19:46,584
She told me that someone
there was hitting on her,

407
00:19:46,586 --> 00:19:48,319
that-that it made
her uncomfortable.

408
00:19:48,321 --> 00:19:50,421
- Did she tell you the man's name?
- No.

409
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:52,423
Because she was worried that
I might do something stupid.

410
00:19:52,425 --> 00:19:54,725
And you know what?
She was right. I would have.

411
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:57,528
I told the police
after she went missing.

412
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,830
They said they looked into it
but that it was a dead end,

413
00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:01,966
that the guy had an alibi.

414
00:20:01,968 --> 00:20:06,737
According to them.

415
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,810
Councilman Barclay would appear

416
00:20:12,812 --> 00:20:14,812
as a friend of the department.

417
00:20:14,814 --> 00:20:17,415
Perhaps the police
who were investigating

418
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:18,516
Prentice's claim that his sister

419
00:20:18,518 --> 00:20:20,351
was being harassed
didn't encounter

420
00:20:20,353 --> 00:20:22,753
a dead end
so much as a "do not enter."

421
00:20:22,755 --> 00:20:26,457
What are you saying? That this
was some sort of cover-up?

422
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:28,459
Well, if there was,
it would be a turn up for us.

423
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:29,860
Conspiracies are fraught.

424
00:20:29,862 --> 00:20:33,564
One secret versus
many keepers.

425
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:35,566
There'd be no shortage
of new leads.

426
00:20:37,704 --> 00:20:39,770
You were gonna let him do it,

427
00:20:39,772 --> 00:20:41,672
weren't you?

428
00:20:41,674 --> 00:20:43,307
Maria's brother...
you were gonna let him

429
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:44,675
hit you with that wrench.

430
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:49,013
Excuse me.

431
00:20:49,015 --> 00:20:51,916
The councilman will see you now.

432
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:54,552
I didn't know Maria well,
but she was sweet.

433
00:20:54,554 --> 00:20:57,555
I spent a lot of late nights
here during the campaign.

434
00:20:57,557 --> 00:20:59,490
I'd see her
when she'd come in to clean,

435
00:20:59,492 --> 00:21:01,592
and she'd ask
how I was holding up.

436
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:04,328
When... Maria
was reported missing,

437
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:07,698
I'd hoped that she'd
just gone back to her country,

438
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:11,002
but... I'd been around
too many cops for too many years

439
00:21:11,004 --> 00:21:13,638
- to really believe that.
- It's our understanding that

440
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,674
one of your reelection team was
briefly considered a suspect.

441
00:21:16,676 --> 00:21:18,776
That's right.

442
00:21:21,514 --> 00:21:23,948
I'm sorry, it's just...

443
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:26,784
I've been advised
not to talk to you.

444
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:29,954
You are aware that
I'm a person of interest.

445
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:32,056
Even though Maria
wasn't a member

446
00:21:32,058 --> 00:21:34,725
of my team, what happened
to her affected us.

447
00:21:34,727 --> 00:21:36,060
I've been keeping myself

448
00:21:36,062 --> 00:21:38,396
- apprised.
- I'm confused.

449
00:21:38,398 --> 00:21:40,031
Why did you agree to see us?

450
00:21:40,033 --> 00:21:41,565
Because...

451
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:43,701
I'm also a fan.

452
00:21:43,703 --> 00:21:45,636
The administrative
hearing last year,

453
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:48,706
you had to make your case
to stay on with the department.

454
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:51,876
A lot of people wanted you gone,
but I looked into you.

455
00:21:51,878 --> 00:21:54,645
And the more I discovered,
the more impressed I was.

456
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:57,581
If you say
you didn't hurt Maria,

457
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:59,450
I'm inclined to believe you.

458
00:21:59,452 --> 00:22:01,819
- Well, thank you.
- It's true,

459
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:04,722
M-Maria was being
harassed by someone

460
00:22:04,724 --> 00:22:06,624
who worked here.

461
00:22:06,626 --> 00:22:09,593
My deputy press secretary...
a man named Tom Graves.

462
00:22:09,595 --> 00:22:13,331
He propositioned her
on several occasions.

463
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:16,000
I wasn't aware
until the police questioned him

464
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:17,535
about her disappearance.

465
00:22:17,537 --> 00:22:19,937
We were told he was cleared.

466
00:22:19,939 --> 00:22:23,074
He was out of the state
the night Maria went missing.

467
00:22:23,076 --> 00:22:25,910
I was told there was a video
of him at his hotel.

468
00:22:25,912 --> 00:22:28,479
I still fired him, of course.

469
00:22:28,481 --> 00:22:30,715
Hmm. So much for the cover-up.

470
00:22:30,717 --> 00:22:31,916
Like I said,

471
00:22:31,918 --> 00:22:33,684
I have a sense for how you work.

472
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:35,753
I know you make a habit
of catching things

473
00:22:35,755 --> 00:22:37,121
other people have missed.

474
00:22:37,123 --> 00:22:39,090
I'll give you
everything

475
00:22:39,092 --> 00:22:41,459
I gave the police
in 2011.

476
00:22:41,461 --> 00:22:44,128
If Tom got away
with something...

477
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:47,098
maybe you'll be able
to figure out how.

478
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,400
<i>Hey.</i>

479
00:22:49,402 --> 00:22:52,503
I thought you said you were going
for a walk to clear your head.

480
00:22:52,505 --> 00:22:54,805
It should trouble you
how often you believe that.

481
00:22:54,807 --> 00:22:56,507
What is this?

482
00:22:56,509 --> 00:22:57,942
Upon our
verification

483
00:22:57,944 --> 00:23:01,412
of the alibi of Tom Graves,
randy press secretary,

484
00:23:01,414 --> 00:23:04,081
I've decided to attack this case
as I would any other.

485
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:06,117
It is not
utterly devoid of fact,

486
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:08,386
and there is even
a strong suspect.

487
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:13,057
Is that a picture of you?

488
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:14,558
I took that one

489
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,026
by accident several years ago.

490
00:23:16,028 --> 00:23:18,729
I was in an altered state,
and I mishandled my phone.

491
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:20,698
God only knows what
I intended to photograph.

492
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,033
If you really want
to beat yourself up...

493
00:23:23,035 --> 00:23:25,136
You think this is
an exercise in self-pity.

494
00:23:25,138 --> 00:23:26,771
I think this is an Olympics
in self-pity.

495
00:23:26,773 --> 00:23:28,139
First you tell
Prentice Gutierrez

496
00:23:28,141 --> 00:23:29,974
he can break your hand,
and now you're

497
00:23:29,976 --> 00:23:32,410
sitting in the dark staring at
an old photograph of yourself.

498
00:23:32,412 --> 00:23:35,045
You did not kill that woman...
stop acting like you did.

499
00:23:35,047 --> 00:23:37,782
You are positive I didn't do it.

500
00:23:37,784 --> 00:23:39,417
- Of course I am.
- How?

501
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:40,785
Because I know you.

502
00:23:40,787 --> 00:23:42,453
Yes. Better than anyone.

503
00:23:42,455 --> 00:23:44,855
But let make one thing
perfectly clear.

504
00:23:44,857 --> 00:23:46,824
You did not know<i> him.</i>

505
00:23:46,826 --> 00:23:48,092
You never

506
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:49,760
met<i> him.</i>

507
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:51,495
So you're Dr. Jekyll now

508
00:23:51,497 --> 00:23:53,063
and he's Mr. Hyde?

509
00:23:53,065 --> 00:23:55,833
You continue to misunderstand.
At that point in my life,

510
00:23:55,835 --> 00:23:58,836
I did not plumb down
into some dark part of myself.

511
00:23:58,838 --> 00:24:02,440
I detached from myself, from
all that was essential to me.

512
00:24:02,442 --> 00:24:04,008
To say that you
can guess what I was

513
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:06,210
capable of is illogical...
I was a different person.

514
00:24:06,212 --> 00:24:09,013
And the fact that I remember
so little from that time

515
00:24:09,015 --> 00:24:11,749
has been nothing
but a tremendous relief to me

516
00:24:11,751 --> 00:24:13,851
until now!

517
00:24:16,155 --> 00:24:18,522
I'm sorry, okay?

518
00:24:18,524 --> 00:24:20,624
I know it hurts,

519
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:21,726
but there is nothing
you can say that's gonna

520
00:24:21,727 --> 00:24:22,827
convince me that
you killed that woman.

521
00:24:22,829 --> 00:24:24,795
Let's adhere
to our sunniest theory

522
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:26,096
for a moment, shall we?

523
00:24:26,098 --> 00:24:27,798
That my note to Maria Gutierrez

524
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,800
was not, in fact,
an invitation to murder,

525
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:32,703
but an agreement
to lend my help as a detective.

526
00:24:32,705 --> 00:24:34,572
What if she knew
she was in danger?

527
00:24:34,574 --> 00:24:35,940
And what if I missed something

528
00:24:35,942 --> 00:24:37,908
that my sober self
would have observed

529
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:40,978
in an instant
that might have saved her life?

530
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:44,815
Would you still consider
my hands blood-free?

531
00:24:57,029 --> 00:24:58,863
Hey, Marcus.

532
00:24:58,865 --> 00:25:00,598
Hey. I ran that list of regulars

533
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,200
from the soup kitchen where
Maria Gutierrez volunteered.

534
00:25:03,202 --> 00:25:06,003
Got back about two dozen names
with arrest records.

535
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:07,771
I just e-mailed them over.

536
00:25:07,773 --> 00:25:10,608
No one jumps out, but they all
seem worth talking to.

537
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:12,109
I cleared my morning
to help out.

538
00:25:12,111 --> 00:25:14,578
Figured I'll take
the first ten or 12 guys.

539
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,780
Thank you, Detective.
That won't be necessary.

540
00:25:16,782 --> 00:25:18,682
Why did you
just do that?

541
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:20,885
Because a meaningful connection
between Maria Gutierrez

542
00:25:20,887 --> 00:25:22,953
and myself
has just materialized.

543
00:25:22,955 --> 00:25:25,890
I recognize a name
on this list.

544
00:25:32,131 --> 00:25:33,898
Go away.

545
00:25:35,268 --> 00:25:38,035
Are you deaf? I said go away!

546
00:25:41,941 --> 00:25:44,775
Aw, man,
you busted my door.

547
00:25:44,777 --> 00:25:45,943
That might be the highlight

548
00:25:45,945 --> 00:25:48,712
of this encounter, Oscar.
You lied to me.

549
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:51,649
You told me you did not know Maria
Gutierrez... it's come to my attention

550
00:25:51,651 --> 00:25:54,251
that you were a regular at the
soup kitchen where she worked.

551
00:25:54,253 --> 00:25:56,153
What?
St. Luke's Parish.

552
00:25:56,155 --> 00:25:58,622
You tell me
you never supped there.

553
00:25:58,624 --> 00:26:01,325
Yeah, yeah, sure I did,
I still do, but...

554
00:26:01,327 --> 00:26:05,029
Come on, man, what, you think I
remember every person that ever

555
00:26:05,031 --> 00:26:06,797
- worked there?
- I think a connection between you

556
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,899
and the woman I'm accused of
murdering is quite remarkable.

557
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:10,801
I think the fact
that you lied to me

558
00:26:10,803 --> 00:26:11,936
about it is rather suspicious.

559
00:26:11,938 --> 00:26:13,203
Come on, Sherlock, please,

560
00:26:13,205 --> 00:26:14,939
- I'm sick.
- You're in withdrawal,

561
00:26:14,941 --> 00:26:16,707
and that's good...
it's going to make it

562
00:26:16,709 --> 00:26:18,008
more difficult for you
to deceive me again.

563
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:20,945
Where were you
the night Maria disappeared?

564
00:26:20,947 --> 00:26:24,748
Oh, what, you think I did it?

565
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,051
Come on, Sherlock,
that's crazy.

566
00:26:27,053 --> 00:26:29,353
Tell us about the note, Oscar.

567
00:26:29,355 --> 00:26:31,121
- What note?!
- The one found

568
00:26:31,123 --> 00:26:33,090
in Maria's purse...
the one that said

569
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:34,625
Sherlock was
gonna meet with her.

570
00:26:34,627 --> 00:26:36,961
Did you trick him
into writing it?

571
00:26:40,232 --> 00:26:42,800
You really don't remember,
do you?

572
00:26:42,802 --> 00:26:45,603
Remember what?

573
00:26:45,605 --> 00:26:48,305
<i>You</i> killed her, man.

574
00:26:48,307 --> 00:26:50,741
You!

575
00:26:50,743 --> 00:26:52,810
Yeah, I bet
you feel

576
00:26:52,812 --> 00:26:54,778
pretty big
these last couple of years...

577
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:57,381
off the horse,
back on the job, all clean

578
00:26:57,383 --> 00:26:58,816
and pretty.

579
00:26:58,818 --> 00:27:00,618
Only you weren't,
were you?

580
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:03,387
No, you had dirt
on you! Blood!

581
00:27:03,389 --> 00:27:05,823
Yeah, you always thought
you were better than me,

582
00:27:05,825 --> 00:27:08,759
even when you were using,
but now you know... you're not.

583
00:27:08,761 --> 00:27:10,294
You're worse.

584
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:14,064
I may be a bum and a junkie,
but I never killed anyone.

585
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:17,067
You will tell me
everything that you know.

586
00:27:17,069 --> 00:27:18,402
All right,
yeah, man.

587
00:27:18,404 --> 00:27:20,037
Yeah, sure.
You know, get a pen.

588
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:23,007
Let me make it easier for you
to pin it all on me.

589
00:27:23,009 --> 00:27:26,076
You want my advice?
Let it go.

590
00:27:26,078 --> 00:27:28,879
If all the police have
is a note...

591
00:27:28,881 --> 00:27:31,181
count your blessings.

592
00:27:36,188 --> 00:27:38,188
- Watson.
- We're leaving?

593
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:40,324
- Yes.
- This is not over.

594
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:42,159
It'd better be,
or trust me,

595
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:45,195
you're gonna spend
the rest of your life in a cell!

596
00:28:01,881 --> 00:28:05,816
You haven't said much
since we got back.

597
00:28:05,818 --> 00:28:09,353
I have a plan,
if you want to hear it.

598
00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:11,188
We meet
with the captain first thing.

599
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,691
We tell him everything.
He brings Oscar in.

600
00:28:13,693 --> 00:28:15,025
If Oscar's still sick,

601
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:17,161
it might not
take him long to crack.

602
00:28:17,163 --> 00:28:18,929
Your plan is flawed.

603
00:28:18,931 --> 00:28:21,732
He will not crack
because he did not do it.

604
00:28:21,734 --> 00:28:24,368
He's been convicted
of purse-snatching and assault.

605
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:27,371
Probably tried to rip Maria off;
she fought back.

606
00:28:27,471 --> 00:28:27,771
No.

607
00:28:27,773 --> 00:28:29,339
His withdrawal symptoms,
as predicted,

608
00:28:29,341 --> 00:28:30,974
made him utterly readable.

609
00:28:30,976 --> 00:28:33,711
He was telling the truth
when he said I did it.

610
00:28:33,713 --> 00:28:35,946
- Are you saying you believe him?
- I'm saying

611
00:28:35,948 --> 00:28:38,816
I believe that he believes
I'm the guilty party.

612
00:28:38,818 --> 00:28:40,718
He's either correct
or he's laboring

613
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,286
under a horrific
misconception.

614
00:28:42,288 --> 00:28:45,189
Either way, he did not do it.

615
00:28:45,191 --> 00:28:48,425
He will not crack.
Your plan is flawed.

616
00:28:51,731 --> 00:28:55,032
Sorry if I upset you
this morning.

617
00:28:55,034 --> 00:28:57,868
At the garage with the wrench.

618
00:28:59,805 --> 00:29:02,272
It's okay.

619
00:29:04,143 --> 00:29:06,744
It's a form of torture...

620
00:29:06,746 --> 00:29:09,379
having to swim
through my old life.

621
00:29:11,817 --> 00:29:12,983
I know that over the years,

622
00:29:12,985 --> 00:29:14,752
you've suffered
your own travails

623
00:29:14,754 --> 00:29:16,954
and you can relate
to a profound sense of guilt.

624
00:29:19,024 --> 00:29:23,093
You cannot relate
to a profound sense of shame.

625
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:32,870
Detectives.

626
00:29:32,872 --> 00:29:34,872
Mr. Holmes.

627
00:29:34,874 --> 00:29:36,140
What is it? What's going on?

628
00:29:37,843 --> 00:29:39,843
Isn't it obvious?

629
00:29:39,845 --> 00:29:41,145
I'm being arrested.

630
00:29:41,147 --> 00:29:42,946
Sherlock Holmes,

631
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:45,149
you're under arrest for
the murder of Maria Gutierrez.

632
00:29:45,151 --> 00:29:47,050
You have the right
to remain silent

633
00:29:47,052 --> 00:29:48,685
and refuse
to answer questions.

634
00:29:48,686 --> 00:29:50,319
Anything you say
may be used against you

635
00:29:50,322 --> 00:29:51,822
in a court of law.

636
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:00,964
All I could get
out of my buddy at the 3-5

637
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:03,033
was that some new witness
came forward.

638
00:30:03,035 --> 00:30:05,002
Someone who said
they saw Sherlock kill Maria?

639
00:30:05,004 --> 00:30:07,337
No, someone who says
they heard him threaten her life

640
00:30:07,339 --> 00:30:08,872
a few days
before she disappeared.

641
00:30:08,874 --> 00:30:10,974
I don't believe it.

642
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:13,010
The guys at
the 3-5 do.

643
00:30:13,012 --> 00:30:16,246
- Right now, that's all that matters.
- I don't suppose

644
00:30:16,248 --> 00:30:18,081
you were able
to put a name to the witness.

645
00:30:18,083 --> 00:30:19,383
They're keeping
everything

646
00:30:19,385 --> 00:30:21,819
under wraps. Like they should.

647
00:30:21,821 --> 00:30:23,987
Holmes is not a cop,
but he's close.

648
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:25,956
They got to protect their case.

649
00:30:25,958 --> 00:30:29,092
You have any luck with that list
I sent you last night?

650
00:30:29,094 --> 00:30:30,961
We did.
Sherlock knew one of the names.

651
00:30:30,963 --> 00:30:32,462
We talked to the guy.

652
00:30:32,464 --> 00:30:34,898
- Is it someone you like for the murder?
- No.

653
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:39,036
But I'm pretty sure another
conversation is in order.

654
00:30:41,907 --> 00:30:43,907
You don't look sick anymore,
Oscar.

655
00:30:43,909 --> 00:30:46,944
I'm guessing you scored last night?

656
00:30:46,946 --> 00:30:49,379
- You know, I never got your name.
- Joan.

657
00:30:49,381 --> 00:30:50,981
I work with Sherlock.

658
00:30:50,983 --> 00:30:53,217
Hi, Joan. Uh...

659
00:30:53,219 --> 00:30:55,485
you here with some money
for a new door?

660
00:30:55,487 --> 00:30:57,321
No, I'm here because I know
you're the witness

661
00:30:57,323 --> 00:30:58,956
who got Sherlock arrested.

662
00:30:58,958 --> 00:31:00,508
- What?
- Okay,

663
00:31:00,509 --> 00:31:02,059
I want to know
what you told them right now.

664
00:31:02,061 --> 00:31:04,962
Wait a second. Wait a second.
Sherlock's in jail?

665
00:31:04,964 --> 00:31:07,030
Okay, don't, Oscar. You threatened him,
you told him he was gonna go to prison.

666
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:11,501
Oh, no. No, this is bad.

667
00:31:11,503 --> 00:31:13,503
If you don't start telling the
truth, it's gonna get worse.

668
00:31:13,505 --> 00:31:16,240
No, you don't get it. It's bad
for both of us, him and me.

669
00:31:16,242 --> 00:31:18,976
Look, I said what I said
to scare him off.

670
00:31:18,978 --> 00:31:21,211
The last thing I wanted
was for him to get arrested.

671
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:23,080
How is this bad for you?

672
00:31:23,082 --> 00:31:25,916
I didn't do it, okay? He did.

673
00:31:25,918 --> 00:31:29,019
- But he can take me down with him.
- Listen,

674
00:31:29,021 --> 00:31:31,955
whatever really happened three
years ago, I will help you.

675
00:31:31,957 --> 00:31:33,957
But first you need to tell me

676
00:31:33,959 --> 00:31:36,260
why you think
Sherlock killed Maria.

677
00:31:36,262 --> 00:31:38,195
I'll do you one better.

678
00:31:38,197 --> 00:31:41,131
I'll show you.

679
00:31:41,133 --> 00:31:42,399
Sherlock was right.

680
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:44,101
I did know Maria
from the soup kitchen.

681
00:31:44,103 --> 00:31:45,903
She was beautiful.

682
00:31:45,905 --> 00:31:47,371
I was a bum, and
she talked to me.

683
00:31:47,373 --> 00:31:50,140
She talked to all of us.

684
00:31:50,142 --> 00:31:53,176
I bragged a couple times that my
buddy was this big private eye.

685
00:31:53,178 --> 00:31:55,345
She'd laugh, and then, one
day, she said she had a problem.

686
00:31:55,347 --> 00:31:56,947
She asked if he could help.

687
00:31:56,949 --> 00:31:58,515
- What was the problem?
- I don't know.

688
00:31:58,517 --> 00:32:00,083
She would only
tell Sherlock.

689
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:01,418
So I went to him,

690
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,053
said I knew someone
who wanted to talk to him.

691
00:32:03,055 --> 00:32:05,289
But he was in a bad way,
had been for weeks.

692
00:32:05,291 --> 00:32:06,990
But he said he would meet her.

693
00:32:06,992 --> 00:32:08,158
That's what the note was about?

694
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,127
The one found in
Maria's purse?

695
00:32:10,129 --> 00:32:12,029
I don't know.
I guess.

696
00:32:12,031 --> 00:32:15,265
Few days later,
I hear she's missing.

697
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:19,136
I go see Sherlock,
and he's wasted.

698
00:32:19,138 --> 00:32:20,971
Can't wake him up.
And I'm nervous,

699
00:32:20,973 --> 00:32:24,041
looking around
for more of whatever he's on.

700
00:32:24,043 --> 00:32:26,977
Instead of his stash...

701
00:32:26,979 --> 00:32:29,947
I find this.

702
00:32:33,152 --> 00:32:37,721
Look, for what it's worth,
I don't think he meant to do it.

703
00:32:37,723 --> 00:32:39,523
No, I just think
he was confused.

704
00:32:39,525 --> 00:32:41,158
That happens sometimes.

705
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,359
One night I crashed with him,

706
00:32:42,361 --> 00:32:44,227
I woke up, and he had
a knife to my throat.

707
00:32:44,229 --> 00:32:45,629
Kept saying I was
a spy or something.

708
00:32:45,631 --> 00:32:47,698
So, you hid these
here to protect him?

709
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,132
No, protect us.

710
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:51,001
I mean, I had a record.
I set up the meeting.

711
00:32:51,003 --> 00:32:53,236
Think the cops won't come
after me as an accessory?

712
00:32:53,238 --> 00:32:55,072
Yeah, so I took the bag
and, you know, a few things

713
00:32:55,074 --> 00:32:56,673
that I could pawn,
and that was that.

714
00:32:56,675 --> 00:33:00,110
I didn't see Sherlock again,
you know, until a few days ago.

715
00:33:00,112 --> 00:33:01,678
Why didn't you just
get rid of the bag?

716
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:05,082
In case he ever came after me
for the stuff I stole

717
00:33:05,084 --> 00:33:07,184
or to blame me
for what he did to Maria.

718
00:33:07,186 --> 00:33:10,120
Hey, this was insurance.

719
00:33:10,122 --> 00:33:12,089
Look, I'm sorry if that's not
what you wanted to hear,

720
00:33:12,091 --> 00:33:13,423
but that's the truth.

721
00:33:13,425 --> 00:33:15,258
I believe you.

722
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,660
Who are you calling?

723
00:33:16,662 --> 00:33:18,729
Friend at the 11th.

724
00:33:18,731 --> 00:33:21,264
You're gonna give this stuff
to the cops?

725
00:33:21,266 --> 00:33:23,567
Hey, this shirt,
these pants...

726
00:33:23,569 --> 00:33:26,236
they're the end of Sherlock.
You get that, right?

727
00:33:26,238 --> 00:33:28,305
Actually, I think you're wrong.
I think they're gonna help him.

728
00:33:43,288 --> 00:33:45,522
It's interesting, Watson,
spending the night in a cell.

729
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:48,759
I'm reminded that there are
good places for bad people.

730
00:33:48,761 --> 00:33:52,262
Is that what you are now...
a bad person?

731
00:33:53,499 --> 00:33:55,632
You've been to see Oscar.

732
00:33:55,634 --> 00:33:58,301
Or you yourself
have been cooking heroin?

733
00:33:58,303 --> 00:34:02,305
May I assume he's the
witness who told Detectives

734
00:34:02,307 --> 00:34:04,674
Demps and McShane that I had
threatened Maria Gutierrez?

735
00:34:04,676 --> 00:34:07,511
Actually, no.

736
00:34:07,513 --> 00:34:09,379
He took this clothing
out of your place

737
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:11,548
a few days
after Maria disappeared.

738
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:15,118
Do you recognize them?

739
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,354
He thought you were wearing them
when you killed her,

740
00:34:17,356 --> 00:34:20,257
but the sizes are wrong, and
the bloodstain pattern suggests

741
00:34:20,259 --> 00:34:22,726
it was worn by someone
who committed a stabbing murder.

742
00:34:22,728 --> 00:34:25,462
Maria died from blunt force
trauma to the skull.

743
00:34:25,464 --> 00:34:29,566
You believe these are evidence
for an entirely different crime?

744
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:32,269
Maria told Oscar
she had a problem

745
00:34:32,271 --> 00:34:33,703
and needed your help.

746
00:34:33,705 --> 00:34:35,639
What if these were the problem?

747
00:34:35,641 --> 00:34:37,474
Maybe they were at your place

748
00:34:37,476 --> 00:34:39,276
because she gave them to you.

749
00:34:39,278 --> 00:34:41,378
Maybe she knew about a murder
and got her hands on these.

750
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:44,281
Instead of bringing them
to the police,

751
00:34:44,283 --> 00:34:46,550
she brought them to me,
heroin addict.

752
00:34:46,552 --> 00:34:48,718
She was in the country

753
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,654
illegally and probably
worried about being deported.

754
00:34:50,656 --> 00:34:52,456
Either way,
the killer found her,

755
00:34:52,458 --> 00:34:55,258
Oscar took the clothes, and
you forgot you ever had them.

756
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,626
Just like you forgot about her.

757
00:34:56,628 --> 00:34:59,296
Now Marcus and the captain
are looking into

758
00:34:59,298 --> 00:35:01,164
stabbing deaths around the time
that she disappeared.

759
00:35:01,166 --> 00:35:03,633
If we can find one that connects
back to her in any way...

760
00:35:03,635 --> 00:35:06,369
a person that she knew, a place
where she spent a lot of time...

761
00:35:06,371 --> 00:35:08,305
We might be able
to identify the real killer.

762
00:35:10,209 --> 00:35:12,309
Your search will need to extend

763
00:35:12,311 --> 00:35:14,211
to missing persons, as well.

764
00:35:14,213 --> 00:35:16,313
If the killer hid the body
of his second victim,

765
00:35:16,315 --> 00:35:19,382
Maria, it stands to reason he
also hid the body of his first.

766
00:35:21,353 --> 00:35:23,854
Good news is, I might be able

767
00:35:23,856 --> 00:35:25,889
to narrow that search
considerably for you.

768
00:35:25,891 --> 00:35:28,225
What do you mean?

769
00:35:28,227 --> 00:35:29,493
I was wrong.

770
00:35:29,495 --> 00:35:31,261
I do recognize that shirt,

771
00:35:31,263 --> 00:35:33,396
but not from three years ago.

772
00:35:33,398 --> 00:35:35,365
The shirt has a double
cuff at the wrist.

773
00:35:35,367 --> 00:35:37,334
The inlay on the buttons
is rather distinctive.

774
00:35:37,336 --> 00:35:39,369
I've seen it recently.

775
00:35:40,572 --> 00:35:44,141
I believe I know
who's behind all of this.

776
00:35:58,257 --> 00:36:00,357
Councilman Barclay,
Tommy Gregson.

777
00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:02,359
We met at a fund-raiser
a few years ago?

778
00:36:02,361 --> 00:36:03,760
Ah, of course.

779
00:36:03,762 --> 00:36:05,529
It's great to
see you again.

780
00:36:05,531 --> 00:36:08,431
This is Detective Bell, and, uh,

781
00:36:08,433 --> 00:36:10,800
- you know Ms. Watson.
- Of course.

782
00:36:10,802 --> 00:36:13,436
There have been some new
developments in Maria's case.

783
00:36:13,438 --> 00:36:15,672
We were hoping
we could discuss them with you.

784
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:19,709
Oh, tell me,
how can I help you?

785
00:36:19,711 --> 00:36:22,712
A new witness
came forward last night.

786
00:36:22,714 --> 00:36:26,349
He told police that he saw
Sherlock threaten Maria.

787
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:27,817
Oh, I hadn't heard.

788
00:36:27,819 --> 00:36:30,654
Is the name Eddie
Bynum familiar to you?

789
00:36:30,656 --> 00:36:32,722
I don't think so.

790
00:36:32,724 --> 00:36:34,391
Why?

791
00:36:34,393 --> 00:36:35,892
Because he's the witness.

792
00:36:35,894 --> 00:36:38,261
He's also a site foreman
at Hatano Construction.

793
00:36:38,263 --> 00:36:40,230
You know his boss,
Matthew Hatano.

794
00:36:40,232 --> 00:36:43,567
<i>They've handled the majority
of the Section 8 housing</i>

795
00:36:43,569 --> 00:36:45,535
developments in your
district the last few years.

796
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:46,970
Okay.

797
00:36:46,972 --> 00:36:48,405
You steered a lot
of business

798
00:36:48,407 --> 00:36:50,674
their way...
a couple of million at least.

799
00:36:50,676 --> 00:36:54,211
<i>If you had asked for a favor,
it'd be hard to say no.</i>

800
00:36:54,213 --> 00:36:57,581
I'm sorry.
I'm not following.

801
00:36:57,583 --> 00:36:59,716
You don't know
Eddie Bynum. Okay.

802
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:01,484
What about Kelsey Prior?

803
00:37:03,689 --> 00:37:06,356
Captain, I'm not sure
what this is,

804
00:37:06,358 --> 00:37:08,358
but I'd like the three of you
to leave.

805
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:11,294
I need to place a call
to the commissioner.

806
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:13,997
If it's about us being here,
I'll save you the trouble.

807
00:37:13,999 --> 00:37:16,833
- He knows.
- Kelsey Prior, Councilman.

808
00:37:16,835 --> 00:37:18,802
You knew her, right?

809
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,740
She was a...

810
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:25,809
She was the wife
of a dear friend.

811
00:37:25,811 --> 00:37:27,777
She was stabbed to
death in her home

812
00:37:27,779 --> 00:37:29,679
in December, 2011.

813
00:37:29,681 --> 00:37:33,016
It looked like a robbery gone
wrong, only it wasn't, was it?

814
00:37:33,018 --> 00:37:35,685
Friend of hers thought
she was having an affair.

815
00:37:35,687 --> 00:37:38,288
The detectives
who caught the case

816
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:39,356
couldn't find
any evidence of that.

817
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:41,291
We're guessing

818
00:37:41,293 --> 00:37:42,525
you were pretty careful.

819
00:37:42,527 --> 00:37:43,960
You had a lot to lose,
after all;

820
00:37:43,962 --> 00:37:45,495
you were trying
to get reelected.

821
00:37:45,497 --> 00:37:47,664
This is ridiculous.

822
00:37:47,666 --> 00:37:49,432
Why don't you tell
us what happened?

823
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:51,768
Did she try to break it off?

824
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:53,436
Threaten
to go public?

825
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:55,472
Whatever it was,

826
00:37:55,474 --> 00:37:57,040
you stabbed
her to death.

827
00:37:57,042 --> 00:37:59,376
You had her blood all over you,
so instead of going home

828
00:37:59,378 --> 00:38:01,344
to your wife,
you came here, to your office.

829
00:38:01,346 --> 00:38:03,480
<i>Told our colleagues
you spend a lot of nights here.</i>

830
00:38:03,482 --> 00:38:04,614
<i>Probably had
a change of clothes.</i>

831
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:06,016
<i>Problem was,</i>

832
00:38:06,018 --> 00:38:07,717
<i>you weren't alone.</i>

833
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:10,754
Maria saw you getting rid
of the evidence, right?

834
00:38:10,756 --> 00:38:12,489
Maybe you took it somewhere

835
00:38:12,491 --> 00:38:13,957
and she followed.

836
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:16,860
<i>Or maybe you dumped it
right here at the office.</i>

837
00:38:16,862 --> 00:38:19,629
Either way, she got
her hands on it.

838
00:38:21,433 --> 00:38:22,632
You must've gotten nervous.

839
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:24,501
Decided you wanted to dispose of

840
00:38:24,503 --> 00:38:26,336
the bloody clothes
some other way.

841
00:38:26,338 --> 00:38:28,705
But when you went to retrieve
them, they were gone.

842
00:38:28,707 --> 00:38:30,373
You thought of Maria.

843
00:38:32,511 --> 00:38:34,544
- I'm calling my attorney.
- Before you do,

844
00:38:34,546 --> 00:38:36,079
you should know
we have the clothes.

845
00:38:36,081 --> 00:38:38,581
Sherlock
remembered

846
00:38:38,583 --> 00:38:41,751
<i>seeing them in a picture when
we were here the other day.</i>

847
00:38:41,753 --> 00:38:43,420
They don't connect you
to Maria's murder,

848
00:38:43,422 --> 00:38:44,454
but they do connect you
to Kelsey's.

849
00:38:44,456 --> 00:38:46,456
Four years ago,
police were able

850
00:38:46,458 --> 00:38:48,091
to determine that
the killer's hand

851
00:38:48,093 --> 00:38:50,060
slipped over the hilt of
the knife when he stabbed her.

852
00:38:50,062 --> 00:38:53,430
He cut himself, leaving
blood at the scene.

853
00:38:53,432 --> 00:38:55,765
When we compel
a DNA sample from you,

854
00:38:55,767 --> 00:38:57,500
it's going to match.

855
00:38:57,502 --> 00:38:59,803
Between that
and Eddie Bynum,

856
00:38:59,805 --> 00:39:02,572
who I'm confident
is going to tell us

857
00:39:02,574 --> 00:39:05,475
his boss put him up to giving
a false statement last night,

858
00:39:05,477 --> 00:39:07,811
you might want
to tell your attorney

859
00:39:07,813 --> 00:39:10,480
he's got his work
cut out for him.

860
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:21,091
The witness, Eddie Bynum,
folded pretty quickly.

861
00:39:21,093 --> 00:39:22,525
So did Matthew Hatano.

862
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:24,828
When the councilman saw
the writing on the wall,

863
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:26,062
he told us everything.

864
00:39:26,064 --> 00:39:27,630
He did kill Kelsey Prior,

865
00:39:27,632 --> 00:39:29,999
and then, a few nights later,
he killed Maria.

866
00:39:30,001 --> 00:39:33,002
The same night I met with her.

867
00:39:33,004 --> 00:39:34,604
Was he following her?

868
00:39:34,606 --> 00:39:36,873
He never knew
about you.

869
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:39,075
What he did,
he did a few hours later.

870
00:39:39,077 --> 00:39:40,543
He went to her place.

871
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:42,445
She wasn't there,
so he called her.

872
00:39:42,447 --> 00:39:44,848
He said he could
explain everything.

873
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:46,583
It was just one
big misunderstanding.

874
00:39:46,585 --> 00:39:48,518
He told her if she
agreed to meet with him,

875
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,787
he could pull some strings
at the department.

876
00:39:50,789 --> 00:39:52,055
Get her brother
out from under

877
00:39:52,057 --> 00:39:53,490
the burglary charge
he was facing.

878
00:39:53,492 --> 00:39:54,924
She believed him.

879
00:39:54,926 --> 00:39:58,027
He picked her up at the
Frobisher Motel in Bayside.

880
00:40:00,465 --> 00:40:04,134
I remembered the name from
some of your old case files.

881
00:40:04,136 --> 00:40:07,404
I know that on
at least two occasions,

882
00:40:07,406 --> 00:40:09,672
you stashed witnesses there
you thought were in danger.

883
00:40:12,611 --> 00:40:13,977
The other night,
you said you were worried

884
00:40:13,979 --> 00:40:15,678
you might have
missed something.

885
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,882
Something you would've noticed
if you were sober.

886
00:40:18,884 --> 00:40:20,717
I don't think
you missed anything.

887
00:40:22,421 --> 00:40:24,954
No, I just forgot someone
who needed my help.

888
00:40:31,897 --> 00:40:33,129
Where are you going?

889
00:40:33,131 --> 00:40:36,099
Walk.

890
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:37,734
It should
trouble me, right?

891
00:40:37,736 --> 00:40:41,004
How often I believe that?

892
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:56,753
Oscar.

893
00:40:56,755 --> 00:40:58,154
Sherlock.

894
00:40:58,156 --> 00:40:59,622
Hey.

895
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:01,624
I heard you
got sprung.

896
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:03,927
Have you ever tried stopping?

897
00:41:05,564 --> 00:41:06,830
Stopping what?

898
00:41:06,832 --> 00:41:09,065
Come on, man.

899
00:41:09,067 --> 00:41:12,035
Rehab's for quitters.

900
00:41:12,037 --> 00:41:13,837
And it would be a shame,
would it not?

901
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:15,505
Quitting all of this?

902
00:41:20,579 --> 00:41:22,745
What's that?

903
00:41:22,747 --> 00:41:24,113
It's contact information

904
00:41:24,115 --> 00:41:26,549
for Hemdale
Rehabilitation Facility.

905
00:41:28,553 --> 00:41:30,019
You now have a standing
reservation there.

906
00:41:30,021 --> 00:41:31,921
Oh, that's...

907
00:41:31,923 --> 00:41:33,189
that's very nice of you.

908
00:41:33,191 --> 00:41:35,492
No, actually, it's not.

909
00:41:35,494 --> 00:41:37,794
I despise you, Oscar.
I always have.

910
00:41:37,796 --> 00:41:39,229
You were never
more than

911
00:41:39,231 --> 00:41:41,231
a sickening means
to a sickening end.

912
00:41:41,233 --> 00:41:43,800
I would excise you
from my life entirely,

913
00:41:43,802 --> 00:41:47,604
but I bear
some responsibility for you.

914
00:41:47,606 --> 00:41:49,739
Three years ago,
you helped steer me

915
00:41:49,741 --> 00:41:51,741
to the lowest point
of my existence.

916
00:41:51,743 --> 00:41:55,111
But a case could be made that
I did the same for you, so...

917
00:41:55,113 --> 00:41:57,514
I came here to make amends.

918
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:01,684
Hemdale, Oscar.

919
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:03,653
Go there, get better...
or don't.

920
00:42:03,655 --> 00:42:06,589
But mark my words,
if I do see you again,

921
00:42:06,591 --> 00:42:07,857
make sure it's because
you're ready

922
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:09,259
to make reparations of your own.

923
00:42:12,631 --> 00:42:15,131
Hey.

924
00:42:15,133 --> 00:42:17,667
You're gonna see me again,
you can count on it.

925
00:42:17,669 --> 00:42:20,003
Only this time, you're gonna be
the one coming back to me.

926
00:42:20,005 --> 00:42:22,205
To where I am.

927
00:42:22,207 --> 00:42:24,107
And it won't be for any amends.
